# This file:
# 1. Provides metadata about the openhatch codebase. This metadata creates a Python "package". This is done by the call to the setup() function -- for example, the "name" parameter sets the name of the package.
# 2. In doing so, it declares the most urgent dependencies without which the code will not function. That is done through the "install_requires" parameter to setup().
# 3. We hard-code URLs to retrieve some of those dependencies. This is usually because the upstream project has put a broken URL on pypi.python.org, or because we host a specially-patched version.
