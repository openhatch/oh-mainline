==========
Login Team
==========

The **Login Team** is the people who can SSH into the main deployment of
OpenHatch.

In order to subscribe to the monitoring-private email list or have push access
to Github, you have to be part of the login team.


Current members
===============

* Jack Grigg (pythonian4000)
* Asheesh Laroia (paulproteus)
* Jessica McKellar (jesstess)
* John Morrissey (jwm)
* Karen Rustad (aldeka)


How to join
===========

* Email asheesh at asheesh.org...

  * Include a copy of the OpenHatch Servers Access & Usage Policies at
    :doc:`/community/login_team_agreement`
  * "Digitally sign" it by typing your name at the end of it (and/or PGP sign,
    if you like)
  * (Here's a summary of the document: You agree to be nice, respectful, and
    communicative. Asheesh can kick you out of the login team, but he will also
    try to be nice, respectful, and communicative. If you find a security hole,
    or otherwise discover a bad problem, you will contact other people and let
    us know. If you take reasonable actions like trying to diagnose the
    security problem, that's cool. If you exploit a security hole to do
    something that you are actually permitted to do, then that's pretty smart
    and crafty of you, and you should tell you did it so we know how cool you
    are.)

* Then if Asheesh agrees you should be on it, he'll let you on. You should hear
  back within four days.


What you get, when you're on the login team
===========================================

* SSH key access to the deploy user account on linode and linode2.
* When we have a VM hosted by OSU OSL, you'll get a personal account and sudo
  permission.
* SSH key permission to push to the Github openhatch/oh-mainline repository.


How to deploy new versions
==========================

* See :doc:`/advanced/deployment`
