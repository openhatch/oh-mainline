OpenHatch Servers Access & Usage Policies
=========================================

Version 1

This version of the OpenHatch Servers Access & Usage Policies becomes effective
on April 30, 2011. 


Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document describes the policies for people who have direct (e.g., SSH)
login access to any account on the OpenHatch Servers. When you are granted this,
you become part of a group of people we call the Login Team.


General statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Privilege**

Access to OpenHatch servers is a privilege, not a right or a commercial service,
and Asheesh Laroia and the Login Team reserve the right to revoke this privilege
at any time, without prior notice. An explanation will be given within 48 hours.
Asheesh promises to try to have a reasonable conversation with you about the
loss of access, including (if you ask for it) the possibility of gaining this
privilege again.


**Guarantees**

There is no guarantee of service. Although the Login Team will do its best to
assure that everything functions perfectly, they can't give any guarantees.


**Penalties**

If someone violates the rules set out in Policies section of this document, as
Asheesh's sole discretion, then Asheesh will revoke that person's access. See
also the "Privilege" section.
 

Rules and Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section defines OpenHatch's Rules and Guidelines. 

* The rules are binding and may not be violated. 
* The guidelines specify rules that may be violated if necessary but we would
  rather one did not.


The Rules
---------

You will not carry out any willful, deliberate, reckless or unlawful act,
interfere with the work of another developer or jeopardize the integrity of
data, equipment, systems programs, or other stored information. 

You will not use the OpenHatch servers for financial gain or for commercial
purposes, including consultancy or any other work outside the scope of official
duties or functions for the time being, without specific authorization from
Asheesh to do so. 

You will not use OpenHatch servers for any unlawful activities whatsoever.

You will not deliberately interfere with or alter the integrity of the Openhatch
servers, by doing any of the following:

* permitting another individual to use your shell login account;
* impersonating other individuals in communication without their permission;
* attempting to capture or crack passwords or encryption, unless you have
  permission from the account-holder to do that;
* destroying or altering data or programs or anything belonging to other users,
  unless you are you doing something a user has explicitly permitted you to do.

You will not restrict or deny access to the system by legitimate users.

You will not transmit threatening or harassing materials.

When you copy private data onto a non-Login Team computer, for example user
passwords that you copy through a MySQL dump, you promise to keep them safe on
the computer you copied them to. You will try to delete them reasonably quickly,
and should try to use the public data snapshots wherever possible.

You do not have to delete session IDs that come to you via the
monitoring-private list, but you should not share them (because sharing session
IDs can permit people to impersonate users).

You will not use OpenHatch Servers in a manner which constitutes net abuse.

You will not allow any bot net or other criminal infiltration of the OpenHatch
Servers through carelessness or abuse, to the best of your ability. If you think
you found or created a security hole, you will tell Asheesh. He promises to be
nice to you in his acknowledgment of the issue.


The Guidelines
--------------

**Processes**: Do not run any long running process without the permission of
Login Team. If you come up with cool ideas of for processes to run, you should
have a conversation with the rest of the Login Team first. Running servers of
any sort (this includes IRC bots) without prior permission from Login Team is
also forbidden. Avoid running processes that are abusive in CPU or memory. If
necessary Login Team will clean up such processes without warning. 

**WWW pages**: In general, web space on the OpenHatch Servers is provided
specifically for the purpose of serving the webapps of OpenHatch itself, whose
goal is to help OSS projects get new contributors. Using your login account to
create private 'vanity' pages on Openhatch Servers is discouraged. (Obviously,
the OpenHatch web app itself promotes some web app.)

**Homedir**: If you receive an email notification that your homedir is large and
that more free space is needed then please promptly take action. The Login Team
may find it necessary to clean up without warning.

**Tunneling**: If you need to use the OpenHatch servers as the end of a tunnel,
like an SSH tunnel, try to talk to Asheesh first to make sure your use is okay.
(If you had to do in a hurry, try to tell him afterward.)

**Mail/News**: Don't use the OpenHatch servers for reading email. If you want to
forward your email address somewhere else, that's fine; create a .forward file.
If a developer becomes unreachable for a prolonged time, his/her accounts, data
and mail forwarding/filtering/etc may be disabled until the person reappears. 

I HAVE READ AND AGREED TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS
