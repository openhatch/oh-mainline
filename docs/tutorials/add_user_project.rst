Adding a User
=============

The OpenHatch community welcomes its users to actively participate in various 
activities such as contributing to a project, finding a bug and adding your own project.

In order to do so you have to sign up for a user account.
The basic steps that are required to do so are:

- Go to the OpenHatch website: http://openhatch.org/
- On the Front page you will see a 'log in/sign up' link in the menu.
- Click on the link. You will be redirected to a login page.
- OpenHatch saves you time by allowing you to use your existing 
  account from one of many networking sites.
- Choose the account that you want to sign up with 
  or click "Sign up without OpenID" on the right hand side.
- Once the verification process is complete you will be redirected to the registration page. 
- Type in your username and click on 'ok'.
 
Adding your Project
===================

If you have a project that you want to add to OpenHatch 
so that developers may contribute and resolve bugs
you can do so by following these simple steps:

- Log in with your chosen account on OpenHatch. 
- Click on the 'Add your project' link on the front page.
- You will be directed to the /guide/ page.
- Click again on 'Add a project' listed in the grey box on the left side.
- You will be directed to the /editor/ page of your profile.
  Click on 'Add a project' in the 'Manage projects' section.
- A form will be displayed then fill it out as follows:

  Type a project name: A suitable name for your project.
  
  Describe this project: A short description about your project.
  
  Check the 'receive maintainer updates' Box if you want to receive updates 
  geared towards project maintainers, including:
   -	new contributors
   -	people who click the 'I want to help' button
   
  Describe your involvement: Your involvement could include patches, translations, design ideas,
   leadership roles, or any other kind of contribution.
  
  Some things you could link to: 
   - bug report
   - archived post to a mailing list
   - staff page
   - WebSVN

- Once you are done, click on 'Save and Publish'.

Your Project will be published and you can view it by clicking on your profile.

You can add/edit or delete a project by clicking on the 'add/edit' link
in the top right of the Projects section.
You can also add a bug tracker by clicking on the 'Add project's bugs' link.
