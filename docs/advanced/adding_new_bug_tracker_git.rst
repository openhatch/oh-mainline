Adding a new bug tracker via git
==========================================

(You can also add a bug tracker `via the website <http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/adding_new_bug_tracker_web.html>`_.)

Clone the repository
====================

You will need to have a local copy of our git repository. You can read about
that in the :doc:`/getting_started/getting_started`.

You will also need a local copy of a sister project,
"oh-bugimporters". You can get that from https://github.com/openhatch/oh-bugimporters .

Overview of steps
=================

You will need to achieve all the following things:

* Adjust oh-bugimporters so that it generates output with data from your
  bug tracker of choice.

* Ensure the data imports properly, by running:

  python manage.py import_bugimporter_data < output_from_bugimporters.jsonlines

* Ensure the web UI shows an option for the new kind of bug tracker. To do
  that, take a look at mysite/customs/models.py.

In a little more detail
=======================

* Clone oh-bugimporters to your local machine, and oh-mainline in parallel,
  such that both folders are on the same level in the directory hierarchy.
* Initialize oh-bugimporters with::

    virtualenv env

  and::

    env/bin/python setup.py develop

  See also oh-bugimporters/docs/intro.rst for more infos about how to
  setup the subproject of oh-bugimporters for development and testing.
* Now add your new tracker to the bugimporter folder, by using one of
  the existing variants as template. If possible, add proper tests too.
* Create a testfile with basic queries and then run a command like::

    env/bin/scrapy runspider bugimporters/main.py -a input_filename=/tmp/input-configuration.yaml -s FEED_FORMAT=json -s FEED_URI=/tmp/results.json -s LOG_FILE=/tmp/scrapy-log -s CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN=1 -s CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=200

  in the oh-bugimporters folder. Here /tmp/input-configuration.yaml is
  the prepared input file with the following basic content (may vary,
  depending on the bugtracker's implementation)::


    meta: {limit: 500, next: null, offset: 0, previous: null, total_count: 1}
    objects:
    - base_url: !!python/unicode 'http://scons.tigris.org/issues'
      bitesized_text: !!python/unicode 'Easy'
      bitesized_type: !!python/unicode 'key'
      bugimporter: !!python/unicode 'tigris'
      custom_parser: !!python/unicode ''
      documentation_text: !!python/unicode 'documentation'
      documentation_type: !!python/unicode 'subcomp'
      existing_bug_urls: []
      get_older_bug_data: null
      queries: [!!python/unicode 'http://scons.tigris.org/issues/xml.cgi']

  After the run, check the log files /tmp/scrapy-log and /tmp/results.json
  for correct results.
* For the website part (note how we're switching to the oh-mainline folder
  now) you have to initialize your local installation of OpenHatch with the
  command::

    python manage.py syncdb --migrate --noinput

* Once you have changed the files mysite/customs/forms.py and models.py to
  add your new tracker type, you have to recreate the migration scripts for
  the customs folder. So call::

    python manage.py schemamigration customs --auto

  See also the page https://openhatch.org/wiki/Making_schema_changes for more
  infos on managing and updating schema changes.
* Now you can start the local OpenHatch site with::

    python manage.py runserver

  and direct your browser to it at http://localhost:8000 .
* Add a user and your project, and setup the new bug tracker for it, as you
  would do normally.
* Ensure that the base folder for temporary import files is writable for your
  current user. The default folder as used in ./run_importer.sh is::

    /var/web/inside.openhatch.org/crawl-logs
  
* Patch the import script ./run_importer.sh and change the URL for the
  OpenHatch site from "https://openhatch.org/..." to "http://localhost:8000".
  Otherwise, the run_importer script tries to download and update all bugs
  that are currently tracked at the real website...which might take a little
  while.
* Run the import script::

    ./run_importer.sh

  and wait for it to finish. Then reload the browser page and check that the
  bugs have indeed been imported properly.
* If you mixed things up, you can reset the database completely at any time
  with::

    python ./manage.py reset_db --router=default

  This will leave you with a blank OpenHatch instance, without any users,
  projects or bugs. Then rinse and repeat the steps above...
