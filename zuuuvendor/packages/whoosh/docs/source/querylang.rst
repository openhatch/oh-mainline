The default query language
==========================

.. highlight:: none

Overview
========

A query consists of *terms* and *operators*. There are two types of terms: single
terms and *phrases*. Multiple terms can be combined with operators such as
*AND* and *OR*.

Whoosh supports indexing text in different *fields*. You must specify the
*default field* when you create the :class:`whoosh.qparser.QueryParser` object.
This is the field in which any terms the user does not explicitly specify a field
for will be searched.


Individual terms and phrases
============================

Find documents containing the term ``render``::

    render

Find documents containing the phrase ``all was well``::

    "all was well"

Note that a field must store Position information for phrase searching to work in
that field.


Boolean operators
=================

Find documents containing ``render`` *and* ``shading``::

    render AND shading

Note that AND is the default relation between terms, so this is the same as::

    render shading

Find documents containing ``render``, *and* also either ``shading`` *or*
``modeling``::

    render AND shading OR modeling

Find documents containing ``render`` but *not* modeling::

    render NOT modeling
    
Find documents containing ``alpha`` but not either ``beta`` or ``gamma``::

    alpha NOT (beta OR gamma)

Note that when no boolean operator is specified between terms, the parser will
insert one, by default AND. So this query::

    render shading modeling
    
is equivalent (by default) to::

    render AND shading AND modeling

See :doc:`customizing the default parser <parsing>` for information on how to
change the default operator to OR.

Group operators together with parentheses. For example to find documents that
contain both ``render`` and ``shading``, or contain ``modeling``::

    (render AND shading) OR modeling


Fields
======

Find the term ``ivan`` in the ``name`` field::

    name:ivan
    
The ``field:`` prefix only sets the field for the term it directly precedes, so
the query::
    
    title:open sesame
        
Will search for ``open`` in the ``title`` field and ``sesame`` in the *default*
field.

To apply a field prefix to multiple terms, group them with parentheses::

    title:(open sesame)
    
This is the same as::

    title:open title:sesame
    
Of course you can specify a field for phrases too::

    title:"open sesame"


Inexact terms
=============

Use "globs" (wildcard expressions using ``?`` to represent a single character
and ``*`` to represent any number of characters) to match terms::

    te?t test* *b?g*``
    
Note that a wildcard starting with ``?`` or ``*`` is very slow. Note also that
these wildcards only match *individual terms*. For example, the query::

    my*life
    
will **not** match an indexed phrase like::

    my so called life
    
because those are four separate terms.


Ranges
======

You can match a range of terms. For example, the following query will match
documents containing terms in the lexical range from ``apple`` to ``bear``
*inclusive*. For example, it will match documents containing ``azores`` and
``be`` but not ``blur``::

    [apple TO bear]

This is very useful when you've stored, for example, dates in a lexically sorted
format (i.e. YYYYMMDD)::

    date:[20050101 TO 20090715]

The range is normally *inclusive* (that is, the range will match all terms
between the start and end term, *as well as* the start and end terms
themselves). You can specify that one or both ends of the range are *exclusive*
by using the ``{`` and/or ``}`` characters::

	[0000 TO 0025}
	{prefix TO suffix}

You can also specify *open-ended* ranges by leaving out the start or end term::

	[0025 TO]
	{TO suffix}


Boosting query elements
=======================

You can specify that certain parts of a query are more important for calculating
the score of a matched document than others. For example, to specify that
``ninja`` is twice as important as other words, and ``bear`` is half as
important::

    ninja^2 cowboy bear^0.5
    
You can apply a boost to several terms using grouping parentheses::

    (open sesame)^2.5 roc


Making a term from literal text
===============================

If you need to include characters in a term that are normally treated specially
the by the parser, such as spaces, colons, or brackets, you can enclose the term
in single quotes::

    path:'MacHD:My Documents'
    'term with spaces'
    title:'function()'
