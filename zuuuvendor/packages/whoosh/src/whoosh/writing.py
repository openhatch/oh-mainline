            w.commit()
        
        Depending on the field type, some fields may take objects other than
        unicode strings. For example, NUMERIC fields take numbers, and DATETIME
        fields take ``datetime.datetime`` objects::
        
            from datetime import datetime, timedelta
            from whoosh import index
            from whoosh.fields import *

            myindex = index.create_in("indexdir", schema)
            
            w = myindex.writer()
            w.add_document(date=datetime.now(), size=5.5, content=u"Hello")
            w.commit()
        
        Instead of a single object (i.e., unicode string, number, or datetime),
        you can supply a list or tuple of objects. For unicode strings, this
        bypasses the field's analyzer. For numbers and dates, this lets you add
        multiple values for the given field::
        
            date1 = datetime.now()
            date2 = datetime(2005, 12, 25)
            date3 = datetime(1999, 1, 1)
            w.add_document(date=[date1, date2, date3], size=[9.5, 10],
                           content=[u"alfa", u"bravo", u"charlie"])
        
        For fields that are both indexed and stored, you can specify an
        alternate value to store using a keyword argument in the form
        "_stored_<fieldname>". For example, if you have a field named "title"
        and you want to index the text "a b c" but store the text "e f g", use
        keyword arguments like this::
        
            writer.add_document(title=u"a b c", _stored_title=u"e f g")
        
        You can boost the weight of all terms in a certain field by specifying
        a ``_<fieldname>_boost`` keyword argument. For example, if you have a
        field named "content", you can double the weight of this document for
        searches in the "content" field like this::
        
            writer.add_document(content="a b c", _title_boost=2.0)
            
        You can boost every field at once using the ``_boost`` keyword. For
        example, to boost fields "a" and "b" by 2.0, and field "c" by 3.0::
        
            writer.add_document(a="alfa", b="bravo", c="charlie",
                                _boost=2.0, _c_boost=3.0)
        
        Note that some scoring algroithms, including Whoosh's default BM25F,
        do not work with term weights less than 1, so you should generally not
        use a boost factor less than 1.

        You cannot currently pass a list or tuple of values to a "unique"
        field.
        
        Because this method has to search for documents with the same unique
        fields and delete them before adding the new document, it is slower
        than using ``add_document``.
        
        * Marking more fields "unique" in the schema will make each
          ``update_document`` call slightly slower.
        
        * When you are updating multiple documents, it is faster to batch
          delete all changed documents and then use ``add_document`` to add
          the replacements instead of using ``update_document``.
        
        Note that this method will only replace a *committed* document;
        currently it cannot replace documents you've added to the IndexWriter
        but haven't yet committed. For example, if you do this:
        
        >>> writer.update_document(unique_id=u"1", content=u"Replace me")
        >>> writer.update_document(unique_id=u"1", content=u"Replacement")
        
        ...this will add two documents with the same value of ``unique_id``,
        instead of the second document replacing the first.

class BufferedWriter(IndexWriter):
    """Convenience class that acts like a writer but buffers added documents to
    a :class:`~whoosh.ramindex.RamIndex` before dumping the buffered documents
    as a batch into the actual index.
    
    In scenarios where you are continuously adding single documents very
    rapidly (for example a web application where lots of users are adding
    content simultaneously), using a BufferedWriter is *much* faster than
    opening and committing a writer for each document you add.
    
    (This class may also be useful for batches of ``update_document`` calls. In
    a normal writer, ``update_document`` calls cannot update documents you've
    added *in that writer*. With ``BufferedWriter``, this will work.)
    
    If you're adding a batches of documents at a time, you can just use a
    regular writer -- you're already committing a "batch" of documents, so you
    don't need this class.
    
    To use this class, create it from your index and *keep it open*, sharing
    it between threads.
    
    >>> from whoosh.writing import BufferedWriter
    >>> writer = BufferedWriter(myindex, period=120, limit=100)
    
    You can control how often the ``BufferedWriter`` flushes the in-memory
    index to disk using the ``period`` and ``limit`` arguments. ``period`` is
    the maximum number of seconds between commits. ``limit`` is the maximum
    number of additions to buffer between commits.
    
    You can read/search the combination of the on-disk index and the buffered
    documents in memory by calling ``BufferedWriter.reader()`` or
    ``BufferedWriter.searcher()``. This allows quasi-real-time search, where
    documents are available for searching as soon as they are buffered in
    memory, before they are committed to disk.
    
    >>> searcher = writer.searcher()
    
    .. tip::
        By using a searcher from the shared writer, multiple *threads* can
        search the buffered documents. Of course, other *processes* will only
        see the documents that have been written to disk. If you want indexed
        documents to become available to other processes as soon as possible,
        you have to use a traditional writer instead of a ``BufferedWriter``.
    
    Calling ``commit()`` on the ``BufferedWriter`` manually commits any batched
    up changes. You can continue to make changes after calling ``commit()``,
    and you can call ``commit()`` multiple times.
    
    .. note::
        This object keeps an underlying writer open and stores documents in
        memory, so you must explicitly call the :meth:`~BufferedWriter.close()`
        method on this object before it goes out of scope to release the
        write lock and make sure any uncommitted changes are saved.
