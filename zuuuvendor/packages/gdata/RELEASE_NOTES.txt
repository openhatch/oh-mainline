=== 2.0.0 ===
June 29, 2009 (revision 777)

- Released support for version 2 of the Google Data APIs protocol. To use the
    new version-aware code, use the gdata.client, atom.data, gdata.data
    modules and classes that derive from them. For example, use 
    gdata.blogger.client.BloggerClient instead of 
    gdata.blogger.service.BloggerService. High level, service specific classes
    are not available yet for other services, so feel free to migrate as they
    become available. The v1 service classes are still included so your
    existing code should be unaffected.
- Included new Blogger samples to illustrate v2 support, a command line demo
    and an app for App Engine.
- Added OAuth sample app which uses App Engine.
- Added the gCal:sequence element to CalendarEventEntry (thanks Anton).

    included in the Host header.
- Fixed pickle error when an OAuth-RSA token is saved to the App Engine
    datastore.
- Fixed missing data in the Document List API unit tests.
- Improved backwards compatibility of v2 data model classes be adding aliases
    to v1 functions.

=== 1.3.3 ===

    parameters are now preserved.
- Fixed incorrect return type for gdata.FeedLinkFromString.
- Added data model classes for the Atom and AtomPub XML elements which support
    version 2 of the Google Data APIs (by means of dynamic AtomPub namespace
    switching). The version 2 XML classes are much more backwards compatible
    with v1 classes than in previous releases.

=== 1.3.2 ===
May 22, 2009 (revision 711)

- Added support for the Google Analytics API. Thanks Sal Uryasev!

  - The v2 auth code now support AuthSub and has been tested on App Engine.
  - Unit tests for the v2 client code will default to not use the local file
      cache but will make live requests unless cached responses is set to
      True in the test configuration module.
  - Older v1 unit tests can now use the v2 testing framework, migrated 
      contacts API tests as a proof of concept. This will come in handy when
      testing backwards compatibility for the 2.0 release.
  - Improved support for unicode and other character encodings in the v2 XML
      core module.

=== 1.3.0 ===

    can be used with version two of the Google Data API protocol. This class
    may change in backwards incompatible ways before the 2.0.0 release, so
    use at your own risk. 

=== 1.2.4 ===
Jan 22, 2009 (revision 603)

- Added a new AtomPubClient class (and supporting classes) which begins a
    foundation on which support for version two of the Google Data protocol
    will be built.

- Added support for OAuth (thanks to Kunal Shah!). Your client can now obtain 
    an authorization token using the OAuth protocol.
- Added support for Secure AuthSub (thanks Eric Bidelman!). Your client can
    digitally sign requests using RSA allowing Google service to verify that
    the request came from your application.
- Added a new module for parsing XML which will be used in future versions to
    support version of the Google Data APIs protocol. This new library handles
    versioning of XML schemas.
- The Google Contacts API sample now pages through results.
- Added phone number rel types using in the Google Contacts API.
- The YouTube service module will use cElementTree if it is available. 
    Improves XML parsing speed.

    apps-apis.google.com.


=== 1.2.2 ===
Oct 15, 2008 (revision 556)

- Added support for the following APIs:
      Google Apps Email Migration API
      Google Apps Email Settings API
      Google Webmaster Tools Data API
    Some modules for the above are not yet fully tested, so please file an 
    issue if you notice something is not working as expected.
- Restored support for gdata.http_request_handler when using App Engine to
    preserve backwards compatibility.
- Simplified auth token management by adding a current_token member to 
    service classes. Also added settings to control when the token_store
    is updated when using SetXToken() methods. The token_store will only be
    queried if there is no current_token.
- Fixed issue with requests to HTTPS URLs in which an AuthSub token was seen
    as invalid because the request contained the default port number (443).
    The library no longer includes the port in the Host header if it is using
    the default.
- Resolved issues with YouTube token scopes.
- Fixed issue which appeared when the Calendar API issues a redirect to a 
    PUT request. The library now correctly retries with a PUT (instead of
    a POST).
- Added workaround for differences in how the App Engine SDK handles 
    redirects.
- Fixed typo in gdata.EntryLink declaration.
- Fixed invalid host errors seen when using some HTTP proxies.


=== 1.2.1 ===
Sep 15, 2008 (revision 529)

- The gdata.alt.appengine module now replaces a Service object's token_store
    with an AppEngineTokenStore which automatically associates auth tokens 
    with the current user and stores the auth tokens in the datastore.
- Streamlined the gdata.auth module. There are now six recommended functions
    for using Google auth mechanisms. GDataService now uses these six
    functions.
- Added an override_token in Service objects (AtomService, GDataService) 
    which bypasses the token_store. This member is helpful when using a 
    single use AuthSub token which is only valid for one request and so
    would not be reused.
- gdata.alt.appengin.run_on_appengine will now return the modified Service
    object. This allows statements like:
    client = gdata.alt.appengin.run_on_appengine(
        gdata.blogger.service.BloggerService())
- Fixed content length header issue in gdata.alt.appengine which caused
    errors when running on App Engine when HTTP headers are set to 
    non-string values.
- Fixed function naming issue in gdata.alt.appengine, a "private" function
    was not accessible in some import styles.
- Fixed issue in atom.http which surfaces when passing in a string for the
    port number. Ports are now cast to ints. 
- Updated pydocs.


=== 1.2.0 ===
Sep 9, 2008 (revision 522)

- Refactored HTTP request mechanisms and the way that Authorization headers
    are created and applied to requests. These changes make it easier to 
    swap out the HTTP layer to allow the library to be used in different
    environments (like Google App Engine). The changes in Auth token logic
    should make it much easier to add support for secure AuthSub and OAuth.
    For more details on this change, see the following wiki page:
    http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/wiki/HTTPRequestRefactoring
- Fixed issues with token string modification which caused certain AuthSub 
    token values to become invalid.
- Created a new module for parsing and constructing URLs (atom.url).
- Created a module for token storage which will lookup the correct auth token
    to be used for a particular URL.
- Auth tokens are now represented as objects and contain information about the
    scopes (URLs) for which they can be used. The token object is responsible
    for adding the Authorization header to the request.
- Added new functions to gdata.auth for extracting the raw token string from
    a response to an AuthSub token upgrade request.
- Added support for the location query parameter in YouTube queries.
- Added groups functionality to the Contacts API library.
- Batch request support added for Contacts API operations.
- Added default behavior to text_db GetTables: when no worksheet name or ID
    is specified, all tables are retrieved.
- Fixed client login for YouTube.
- Fixed issue in YouTube service when setting the developer key.
- Fixed bug in YouTube service which raised an exception when inserting a
    video using a file-like object.
- Added a method to Feed and Entry classes to find the "previous" link.
- A failure when attempting to upgrade a single use AuthSub token to a session
    token will now raise an exception.
- AppsForYourDomainException now uses Python2.5 style exception construction.
- Moved the logic for using this library on Google App Engine into a new 
    module: gdata.alt.appengine.


=== 1.1.1 ===
June 13, 2008 (revision 421)

- Added support for new feeds available in the Google Contacts API. Adding
    contact groups, querying for contacts in a group, specifying extended
    properties, and setting the contact's photo are now supported.
- The ExtendedProperty class can now contain a blob of XML instead of just
    an attribute value. This is used in the Google Contacts Data API. 
- The YouTube service now has methods for updating playlists and removing a
    video from a playlist.
- Added geo-location to the YouTube service class.
- When using ClientLogin with Blogger, the default account type is now set
    to 'GOOGLE'. This prevents the rare problem of a user having a Google
    Apps account which conflicts with his or her Google Account used for
    Blogger.
- Added support for the in-reply-to element which appears in Blogger 
    comments.


=== 1.1.0 ===
June 6, 2008 (revision 403)

- Added modules for YouTube.
- Added modules for Blogger to simplify using the Blogger API.

- Bug fix, added timezone element to CalendarEventFeed.
- Improved docstrings to describe token access methods (specifically 
    GetAuthSubToken).
- Moved ExtendedProperty class into gdata module from gdata.calendar since
    it is now also used in the Google Contacts Data API. 


=== 1.0.13 ===
May 8, 2008 (revision 357)

- Added sample code illustrating the use of the Contacts API modules.
- Added a mock_service module which will allow for faster test execution
    by simulating a server and replaying recordings instead of making
    HTTP requests to a remote server.
- Fixed a but in the gdata.auth module which could cause certain characters
    at the start of the token to be removed incorrectly.
- Fixed a bug in the gdata.apps.service module which caused an import to 
    fail when loading ElementTree in some cases.
- Service unit tests should run correctly when using run_service_tests
