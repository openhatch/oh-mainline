"""Minify Javascript and CSS with
`YUI Compressor <http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/>`_.

YUI Compressor is an external tool written in Java, which needs to be
available. You can define a ``YUI_COMPRESSOR_PATH`` setting that
points to the ``.jar`` file. Otherwise, an environment variable by
the same name is tried. The filter will also look for a ``JAVA_HOME``
environment variable to run the ``.jar`` file, or will otherwise
assume that ``java`` is on the system path.
