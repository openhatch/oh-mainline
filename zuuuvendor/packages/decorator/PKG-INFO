        :Requires: Python 2.4+
        :Download page: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator
        :Installation: ``easy_install decorator``
        :License: BSD license
        
        Installation
        -------------
        
        If you are lazy, just perform
        
        $ easy_install decorator
        
        which will install just the module on your system. Notice that
        Python 3 requires the easy_install version of the distribute_ project.
        
        If you prefer to install the full distribution from source, including
        the documentation, download the tarball_, unpack it and run
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        in the main directory, possibly as superuser.
        
        .. _tarball: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator
        .. _distribute: http://packages.python.org/distribute/
        
        Testing
        --------
        
        For Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 run
        
        $ python documentation.py
        
        for Python 3.X run
        
        $ python documentation3.py
        
        You will see a few innocuous errors with Python 2.5, because some
        inner details such as the introduction of the ArgSpec namedtuple and
        Thread.__repr__ changed. You may safely ignore them. 
        
        You cannot run the tests in Python 2.4, since there is a test using
        the with statement, but the decorator module is expected to work
        anyway (it has been used in production with Python 2.4 for years). My
        plan is to keep supporting all Python versions >= 2.4 in the core
        module, but I will keep the documentation and the tests updated only
        for the latest Python versions in both the 2.X and 3.X branches.
        
        Finally, notice that you may run into trouble if in your system there
        is an older version of the decorator module; in such a case remove the
        old version.
