    We need to be able to get the username of the current logged-in
    user from PHP.  Our starting point is the sessionid, which
    is send in every request as a cookie.  We cannot go from this to
    the username in PHP, because the session data (for example,
    _auth_user_id) is stored in a pickled dictionary, and I don't
    even want to think about unpickling Python dictionaries from PHP.
    So, we use our own authentication middleware to store a separate
    model object which has the same kind of association with the
    session as the UserProfile does with the user.  Doing this means
    that we're maintaining a DB table from which PHP can read the
    user ID, by going via the Users table.
