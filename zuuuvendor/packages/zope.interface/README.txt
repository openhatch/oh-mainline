``zope.interface`` README
=========================

This package is intended to be independently reusable in any Python
project. It is maintained by the `Zope Toolkit project
<http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/>`_.

This package provides an implementation of "object interfaces" for Python.
Interfaces are a mechanism for labeling objects as conforming to a given
API or contract. So, this package can be considered as implementation of
the `Design By Contract`_ methodology support in Python.
