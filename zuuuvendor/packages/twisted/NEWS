Twisted Core 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
================================

Features
--------
 - The reactor is not restartable, but it would previously fail to
   complain. Now, when you restart an unrestartable reactor, you get
   an exception. (#2066)
 - twisted.plugin now only emits a short log message, rather than a
   full traceback, if there is a problem writing out the dropin cache
   file. (#2409)
 - Added a 'replacement' parameter to the
   'twisted.python.deprecate.deprecated' decorator.  This allows
   deprecations to unambiguously specify what they have been
   deprecated in favor of. (#3047)
 - Added access methods to FilePath for FilePath.statinfo's st_ino,
   st_dev, st_nlink, st_uid, and st_gid fields.  This is in
   preparation for the deprecation of FilePath.statinfo. (#4712)
 - IPv4Address and UNIXAddress now have a __hash__ method. (#4783)
 - twisted.protocols.ftp.FTP.ftp_STOR now catches `FTPCmdError`s
   raised by the file writer, and returns the error back to the
   client. (#4909)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twistd will no longer fail if a non-root user passes --uid 'myuid'
   as a command-line argument. Instead, it will emit an error message.
   (#3172)
 - IOCPReactor now sends immediate completions to the main loop
   (#3233)
 - trial can now load test methods from multiple classes, even if the
   methods all happen to be inherited from the same base class.
   (#3383)
 - twisted.web.server will now produce a correct Allow header when a
   particular render_FOO method is missing. (#3678)
 - HEAD requests made to resources whose HEAD handling defaults to
   calling render_GET now always receive a response with no body.
   (#3684)
 - trial now loads decorated test methods whether or not the decorator
   preserves the original method name. (#3909)
 - t.p.amp.AmpBox.serialize will now correctly consistently complain
   when being fed Unicode. (#3931)
 - twisted.internet.wxreactor now supports stopping more reliably.
   (#3948)
 - reactor.spawnProcess on Windows can now handle ASCII-encodable
   Unicode strings in the system environment (#3964)
 - When C-extensions are not complied for twisted, on python2.4, skip
   a test in twisted.internet.test.test_process that may hang due to a
   SIGCHLD related problem. Running 'python setup.py build_ext
   --inplace' will compile the extension and cause the test to both
   run and pass. (#4331)
 - twisted.python.logfile.LogFile now raises a descriptive exception
   when passed a log  directoy which does not exist. (#4701)
 - Fixed a bug where Inotify will fail to add a filepatch to watchlist
   after it has been added/ignored previously. (#4708)
 - IPv4Address and UNIXAddress object comparison operators fixed
   (#4817)
 - twisted.internet.task.Clock now sorts the list of pending calls
   before and after processing each call (#4823)
 - ConnectionLost is now in twisted.internet.error.__all__ instead of
   twisted.words.protocols.jabber.xmlstream.__all__. (#4856)
 - twisted.internet.process now detects the most appropriate mechanism
   to use for detecting the open file descriptors on a system, getting
   Twisted working on FreeBSD even when fdescfs is not mounted.
   (#4881)
 - twisted.words.services referenced nonexistent
   twisted.words.protocols.irc.IRC_NOSUCHCHANNEL. This has been fixed.
   Related code has also received test cases. (#4915)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - The INSTALL file now lists all of Twisted's dependencies. (#967)
 - Added the stopService and startService methods to all finger
   example files. (#3375)
 - Missing reactor.run() calls were added in the UDP and client howto
   documents. (#3834)
 - The maxRetries attribute of
   twisted.internet.protocols.RetryingClientFactory now has API
   documentation. (#4618)
 - Lore docs pointed to a template that no longer existed, this has
   been fixed. (#4682)
 - The `servers` argument to `twisted.names.client.createResolver` now
   has more complete API documentation. (#4713)
 - Linked to the Twisted endpoints tutorial from the Twisted core
   howto list.  (#4773)
 - The Endpoints howto now links to the API documentation. (#4774)
 - The Quotes howto is now more clear in its PYTHONPATH setup
   instructions. (#4785)
 - The API documentation for DeferredList's fireOnOneCallback
   parameter now gives the correct order of the elements of the result
   tuple. (#4882)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - returning a value other than None from IProtocol.dataReceived was
   deprecated (#2491)
 - Deprecated the --extra option in trial.  (#3372)
 - twisted.protocols._c_urlarg has been removed. (#4162)
 - Remove the --report-profile option for twistd, deprecated since
   2007. (#4236)
 - Deprecated twisted.persisted.journal.  This library is no longer
   maintained.  (#4298)
 - Removed twisted.protocols.loopback.loopback, which has been
   deprecated since Twisted 2.5. (#4547)
 - __getitem__ __getslice__ and __eq__ (tuple comparison, indexing)
   removed from twisted.internet.address.IPv4Address and
   twisted.internet.address.UNIXAddress classes UNIXAddress and
   IPv4Address properties _bwHack are now deprecated in
   twisted.internet.address (#4817)
 - twisted.python.reflect.allYourBase is now no longer used, replaced
   with inspect.getmro (#4928)
 - allYourBase and accumulateBases are now deprecated in favor of
   inspect.getmro. (#4946)

Twisted Conch 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
=================================

Bugfixes
--------
 - The transport for subsystem protocols now declares that it
   implements ITransport and implements the getHost and getPeer
   methods. (#2453)
 - twisted.conch.ssh.transport.SSHTransportBase now responds to key
   exchange messages at any time during a connection (instead of only
   at connection setup).  It also queues non-key exchange messages
   sent during key exchange to avoid corrupting the connection state.
   (#4395)
 - Importing twisted.conch.ssh.common no longer breaks pow(base, exp[,
   modulus]) when the gmpy package is installed and base is not an
   integer. (#4803)
 - twisted.conch.ls.lsLine now returns a time string which does not
   consider the locale. (#4937)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - Changed the man page for ckeygen to accurately reflect what it
   does, and corrected its synposis so that a second "ckeygen" is not
   a required part of the ckeygen command line.  (#4738)

Other
-----
 - #2112


Twisted Lore 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)

Features
--------
 - The `twistd mail` command line now accepts endpoint descriptions
   for POP3 and SMTP servers. (#4739)
 - The twistd mail plugin now accepts new authentication options via
   strcred.AuthOptionMixin.  These include --auth, --auth-help, and
   authentication type-specific help options. (#4740)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.mail.imap4.IMAP4Server now generates INTERNALDATE strings
   which do not consider the locale. (#4937)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - Added a simple SMTP example, showing how to use sendmail. (#4042)

Other
-----

 - #4162

No significant changes have been made for this release.


Twisted Runner 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
==================================

No significant changes have been made for this release.


Twisted Web 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web._newclient.HTTPParser (and therefore Agent) now handles
   HTTP headers delimited by bare LF newlines. (#3833)
 - twisted.web.client.downloadPage now accepts the `afterFoundGet`
   parameter, with the same meaning as the `getPage` parameter of the
   same name. (#4364)
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.Proxy constructor now takes additional 'timeout'
   and 'reactor' arguments. The 'timeout' argument defaults to 30
   seconds. (#4741)
 - Twisted Web now has a templating system, twisted.web.template,
   which is a direct, simplified derivative of Divmod Nevow. (#4939)

Bugfixes
--------
 - HTTPPageGetter now adds the port to the host header if it is not
   the default for that scheme. (#3857)
 - twisted.web.http.Request.write now raises an exception if it is
   called after response generation has already finished. (#4317)
 - twisted.web.client.HTTPPageGetter and twisted.web.client.getPage
   now no longer make two requests when using afterFoundGet. (#4760)
 - twisted.web.twcgi no longer adds an extra "content-type" header to
   CGI responses. (#4786)
 - twisted.web will now properly specify an encoding (UTF-8) on error,
   redirect, and directory listing pages, so that IE7 and previous
   will not improperly guess the 'utf7' encoding in these cases.
   Please note that Twisted still sets a *default* content-type of
   'text/html', and you shouldn't rely on that: you should set the
   encoding appropriately in your application. (#4900)
 - twisted.web.http.Request.setHost now sets the port in the host
   header if it is not the default. (#4918)
 - default NOT_IMPLEMENTED and NOT_ALLOWED pages now quote the request
   method and URI respectively, to protect against browsers which
   don't quote those values for us. (#4978)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - The XML-RPC howto now includes an example demonstrating how to
   access the HTTP request object in a server-side XML-RPC method.
   (#4732)
 - The Twisted Web client howto now uses the correct, public name for
   twisted.web.client.Response. (#4769)
 - Some broken links were fixed, descriptions were updated, and new
   API links were added in the Resource Templating documentation
   (resource-templates.xhtml) (#4968)

Other
-----
 - #2271, #2386, #4162, #4733, #4855, #4911, #4973


Twisted Words 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
=================================

Features
--------
 - twisted.words.protocols.irc.IRCClient now has an invite method.
   (#4820)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.words.protocols.irc.IRCClient.say is once again able to
   send messages when using the default value for the length limit
   argument. (#4758)
 - twisted.words.protocols.jabber.jstrports is once again able to
   parse jstrport description strings. (#4771)
 - twisted.words.protocols.msn.NotificationClient now calls the
   loginFailure callback when it is unable to connect to the Passport
   server due to missing SSL dependencies. (#4801)
 - twisted.words.protocols.jabber.xmpp_stringprep now always uses
   Unicode version 3.2 for stringprep normalization. (#4850)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - Removed the non-working AIM bot example, depending on the obsolete
   twisted.words.protocols.toc functionality. (#4007)
 - Outdated GUI-related information was removed from the IM howto.
   (#4054)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - Remove twisted.words.protocols.toc, that was largely non-working
   and useless since AOL disabled TOC on their AIM network. (#4363)

Other
-----
 - #4733, #4902


Twisted Core 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
================================

Features
--------
 - twisted.internet.cfreactor has been significantly improved.  It now
   runs, and passes, the test suite.  Many, many bugs in it have been
   fixed, including several segfaults, as it now uses PyObjC and
   longer requires C code in Twisted. (#1833)
 - twisted.protocols.ftp.FTPRealm now accepts a parameter to override
   "/home" as the container for user directories.  The new
   BaseFTPRealm class in the same module also allows easy
   implementation of custom user directory schemes. (#2179)
 - twisted.python.filepath.FilePath and twisted.python.zippath.ZipPath
   now have a descendant method to simplify code which calls the child
   method repeatedly. (#3169)
 - twisted.python.failure._Frame objects now support fake f_locals
   attribute. (#4045)
 - twisted.internet.endpoints now has 'serverFromString' and
   'clientFromString' APIs for constructing endpoints from descriptive
   strings. (#4473)
 - The default trial reporter now combines reporting of tests with the
   same result to shorten its summary output. (#4487)
 - The new class twisted.protocols.ftp.SystemFTPRealm implements an
   FTP realm which uses system accounts to select home directories.
   (#4494)
 - twisted.internet.reactor.spawnProcess now wastes less time trying
   to close non-existent file descriptors on POSIX platforms. (#4522)
 - twisted.internet.win32eventreactor now declares that it implements
   a new twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorWin32Events interface.
   (#4523)
 - twisted.application.service.IProcess now documents its attributes
   using zope.interface.Attribute. (#4534)
 - twisted.application.app.ReactorSelectionMixin now saves the value
   of the --reactor option in the "reactor" key of the options object.
   (#4563)
 - twisted.internet.endpoints.serverFromString and clientFromString,
   and therefore also twisted.application.strports.service, now
   support plugins, so third parties may implement their own endpoint
   types. (#4695)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.internet.defer.Deferred now handles chains iteratively
   instead of recursively, preventing RuntimeError due to excessive
   recursion when handling long Deferred chains. (#411)
 - twisted.internet.cfreactor now works with trial. (#2556)
 - twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool.close may now be called
   even if the connection pool has not yet been started.  This will
   prevent the pool from ever starting. (#2680)
 - twisted.protocols.basic.NetstringReceiver raises
   NetstringParseErrors for  invalid netstrings now. It handles empty
   netstrings ("0:,") correctly, and  the performance for receiving
   netstrings has been improved. (#4378)
 - reactor.listenUDP now returns an object which declares that it
   implements IListeningPort. (#4462)
 - twisted.python.randbytes no longer uses PyCrypto as a secure random
   number source (since it is not one). (#4468)
 - twisted.internet.main.installReactor now blocks installation of
   another reactor when using python -O (#4476)
 - twisted.python.deprecate.deprecatedModuleAttribute now emits only
   one warning when used to deprecate a package attribute which is a
   module. (#4492)
 - The "brief" mode of twisted.python.failure.Failure.getTraceback now
   handles exceptions raised by the underlying exception's __str__
   method. (#4501)
 - twisted.words.xish.domish now correctly parses XML with namespaces
   which include whitespace. (#4503)
 - twisted.names.authority.FileAuthority now generates correct
   negative caching hints, marks its referral NS RRs as non-
   authoritative, and correctly generates referrals for ALL_RECORDS
   requests. (#4513)
 - twisted.internet.test.reactormixins.ReactorBuilder's attribute
   `requiredInterface` (which should an interface) is now
   `requiredInterfaces` (a list of interfaces) as originally described
   per the documentation. (#4527)
 - twisted.python.zippath.ZipPath.__repr__ now correctly formats paths
   with ".." in them (by including it). (#4535)
 - twisted.names.hosts.searchFileFor has been fixed against
   refcounting dependency. (#4540)
 - The POSIX process transports now declare that they implement
   IProcessTransport. (#4585)
 - Twisted can now be built with the LLVM clang compiler, with
   'CC=clang python setup.py build'.  C code that caused errors with
   this compiler has been removed. (#4652)
 - trial now puts coverage data in the path specified by --temp-
   directory, even if that option comes after --coverage on the
   command line. (#4657)
 - The unregisterProducer method of connection-oriented transports
   will now cause the connection to be closed if there was a prior
   call to loseConnection. (#4719)
 - Fixed an issue where the new StreamServerEndpointService didn't log
   listen errors.  (This was a bug not present in any previous
   releases, as this class is new.) (#4731)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - The trial man page now documents the meaning of the final line of
   output of the default reporter. (#1384)
 - The API documentation for twisted.internet.defer.DeferredList now
   goes into more depth about the effects each of the __init__ flags
   that class accepts. (#3595)
 - There is now narrative documentation for the endpoints APIs, in the
   'endpoints' core howto, as well as modifications to the 'writing
   clients' and 'writing servers' core howto documents to indicate
   that endpoints are now the preferred style of listening and
   connecting. (#4478)
 - trial's man page now documents the --disablegc option in more
   detail. (#4511)
 - trial's coverage output format is now documented in the trial man
   page. (#4512)
 - Broken links and spelling errors in the finger tutorial are now
   fixed. (#4516)
 - twisted.internet.threads.blockingCallFromThread's docstring is now
   explicit about Deferred support. (#4517)
 - twisted.python.zippath.ZipPath.child now documents its handling of
   ".." (which is not special, making it different from
   FilePath.child). (#4535)
 - The API docs for twisted.internet.defer.Deferred now cover several
   more of its (less interesting) attributes. (#4538)
 - LineReceiver, NetstringReceiver, and IntNStringReceiver from
   twisted.protocols.basic now have improved API documentation for
   read callbacks and write methods. (#4542)
 - Tidied up the Twisted Conch documentation for easier conversion.
   (#4566)
 - Use correct Twisted version for when cancellation was introduced in
   the Deferred docstring. (#4614)
 - The logging howto is now more clear about how the standard library
   logging module and twisted.python.log can be integrated. (#4642)
 - The finger tutorial still had references to .tap files. This
   reference has now been removed. The documentation clarifies
   "finger.tap" is a module and not a filename. (#4679)
 - The finger tutorial had a broken link to the
   twisted.application.service.Service class, which is now fixed.
   Additionally, a minor typo ('verison') was fixed.  (#4681)
 - twisted.protocols.policies.TimeoutMixin now has clearer API
   documentation. (#4684)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.setTimeout has been removed, after
   being deprecated since Twisted 2.0. (#1702)
 - twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorTime.cancelCallLater
   (deprecated since  2007) and
   twisted.internet.interfaces.base.ReactorBase.cancelCallLater
   (deprecated since 2002) have been removed. (#4076)
 - Removed twisted.cred.util.py, which has been deprecated since
   Twisted 8.3. (#4107)
 - twisted.python.text.docstringLStrip was deprecated. (#4328)
 - The module attributes `LENGTH`, `DATA`, `COMMA`, and `NUMBER` of
   twisted.protocols.basic (previously used by `NetstringReceiver`)
   are now deprecated. (#4541)
 - twisted.protocols.basic.SafeNetstringReceiver, deprecated since
   2001 (before Twisted 2.0), was removed. (#4546)
 - twisted.python.threadable.whenThreaded, deprecated since Twisted
   2.2.0, has been removed. (#4550)
 - twisted.python.timeoutqueue, deprecated since Twisted 8.0, has been
   removed. (#4551)
 - iocpreactor transports can no longer be pickled. (#4617)

Twisted Conch 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
=================================

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.conch.ssh.factory.SSHFactory no longer disables coredumps.
   (#2715)
 - The Deferred returned by twisted.conch.telnet.TelnetTransport.will
   now fires with an OptionRefused failure if the peer responds with a
   refusal for the option negotiation. (#4231)
 - SSHServerTransport and SSHClientTransport in
   twisted.conch.ssh.transport no longer use PyCrypto to generate
   random numbers for DH KEX.  They also now generate values from the
   full valid range, rather than only half of it. (#4469)
 - twisted.conch.ssh.connection.SSHConnection now errbacks leftover
   request deferreds on connection shutdown. (#4483)

================================

No significant changes have been made for this release.

Other
-----
 - #4571


Twisted Mail 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
================================

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - The email server example now demonstrates how to set up
   authentication and authorization using twisted.cred. (#4609)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.mail.smtp.sendEmail, deprecated since mid 2003 (before
   Twisted 2.0), has been removed. (#4529)

Other
-----
 - #4038, #4572


Twisted Names 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
=================================

Features
--------
 - twisted.names.server can now serve SPF resource records using
   twisted.names.dns.Record_SPF.  twisted.names.client can query for
   them using lookupSenderPolicy.   (#3928)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.names.common.extractRecords doesn't try to close the
   transport anymore in case of recursion, as it's done by the
   Resolver itself now. (#3998)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - Tidied up the Twisted Names documentation for easier conversion.
   (#4573)


Twisted News 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
================================

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.news.database.PickleStorage now invokes the email APIs
   correctly, allowing it to actually send moderation emails. (#4528)


Twisted Pair 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
================================

No significant changes have been made for this release.


Twisted Runner 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
==================================

No significant changes have been made for this release.


Twisted Web 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.XMLRPC.xmlrpc_* methods can now be decorated
   using withRequest to cause them to be passed the HTTP request
   object. (#3073)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.QueryProtocol.handleResponse now disconnects
   from the server, meaning that Twisted XML-RPC clients disconnect
   from the server as soon as they receive a response, rather than
   relying on the server to disconnect. (#2518)
 - twisted.web.twcgi now generates responses containing all
   occurrences of duplicate headers produced by CGI scripts, not just
   the last value. (#4742)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web.trp, which has been deprecated since Twisted 9.0, was
   removed. (#4299)

Other
-----
 - #4576, #4577, #4709, #4723


Twisted Words 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
=================================

Features
--------
 - twisted.words.protocols.irc.IRCClient.msg now enforces a maximum
   length for messages, splitting up messages that are too long.
   (#4416)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.words.protocols.irc.IRCClient no longer invokes privmsg()
   in the default noticed() implementation. (#4419)
 - twisted.words.im.ircsupport.IRCProto now sends the correct name in
   the USER command. (#4641)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - Remove twisted.words.im.proxyui and twisted.words.im.tap. (#1823)


Twisted Core 10.1.0 (2010-06-27)
================================

Features
--------
 - Add linux inotify support, allowing monitoring of file system
   events. (#972)
 - Deferreds now support cancellation. (#990)
 - Added new "endpoint" interfaces in twisted.internet.interfaces,
   which abstractly describe stream transport endpoints which can be
   listened on or connected to.  Implementations for TCP and SSL
   clients and servers are present in twisted.internet.endpoints.
   Notably, client endpoints' connect() methods return cancellable
   Deferreds, so code written to use them can bypass the awkward
   "ClientFactory.clientConnectionFailed" and
   "Connector.stopConnecting" methods, and handle errbacks from or
   cancel the returned deferred, respectively. (#1442)
 - twisted.protocols.amp.Integer's documentation now clarifies that
   integers of arbitrary size are supported and that the wire format
   is a base-10 representation. (#2650)
 - twisted.protocols.amp now includes support for transferring
   timestamps (amp.DateTime) and decimal values (amp.Decimal). (#2651)
 - twisted.protocol.ftp.IWriteFile now has a close() method, which can
   return a Deferred. Previously a STOR command would finish
   immediately upon the receipt of the last byte of the uploaded file.
   With close(), the backend can delay the finish until it has
   performed some other slow action (like storing the data to a
   virtual filesystem). (#3462)
 - FilePath now calls os.stat() only when new status information is
   required, rather than immediately when anything changes.  For some
   applications this may result in fewer stat() calls.  Additionally,
   FilePath has a new method, 'changed', which applications may use to
   indicate that the FilePath may have been changed on disk and
   therefore the next status information request must  fetch a new
   stat result.  This is useful if external systems, such as C
   libraries, may have changed files that Twisted applications are
   referencing via a FilePath. (#4130)
 - Documentation improvements are now summarized in the NEWS file.
   (#4224)

Bugfixes
--------
 - On POSIX platforms, reactors now support child processes in a way
   which doesn't cause other syscalls to sometimes fail with EINTR (if
   running on Python 2.6 or if Twisted's extension modules have been
   built). (#733)
 - Substrings are escaped before being passed to a regular expression
   for searching to ensure that they don't get interpreted as part of
   the expression. (#1893)

   normal file (except when using epollreactor). (#2259)
 -  (#2367)
 - The tap2rpm script now works with modern versions of RPM. (#3292)
 - twisted.python.modules.walkModules will now handle packages
   explicitly precluded from importing by a None placed in
   sys.modules. (#3419)
 - ConnectedDatagramPort now uses stopListening when a connection
   fails instead of the deprecated loseConnection. (#3425)
 - twisted.python.filepath.FilePath.setContent is now safe for
   multiple processes to use concurrently. (#3694)
 - The mode argument to the methods of
   twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorUNIX is no longer deprecated.
   (#4078)
 - Do not include blacklisted projects when generating NEWS. (#4190)
 - When generating NEWS for a project that had no significant changes,
   include a section for that project and say that there were no
   interesting changes. (#4191)
 - Redundant 'b' mode is no longer passed to calls to FilePath.open
   and FilePath.open itself now corrects the mode when multiple 'b'
   characters are present, ensuring only one instance of 'b' is
   provided, as a workaround for http://bugs.python.org/issue7686.
   (#4207)
 - HTML tags inside <pre> tags in the code snippets are now escaped.
   (#4336)

   close in the twisted.internet.stdio.StandardIO transport. (#4352)
 - twisted.application.internet no longer generates an extra and
   invalid entry in its __all__ list for the nonexistent
   MulticastClient. (#4373)

   methods now return IPv4Address instances by default. (#4401)
 - twisted.protocols.amp.BinaryBoxProtocol will no longer deliver an
   empty string to a switched-to protocol's dataReceived method when
   the BinaryBoxProtocol's buffer happened to be empty at the time of
   the protocol switch. (#4405)
 - IReactorUNIX.listenUNIX implementations now support abstract
   namespace sockets on Linux. (#4421)
 - Files opened with FilePath.create() (and therefore also files
   opened via FilePath.open() on a path with alwaysCreate=True) will
   now be opened in binary mode as advertised, so that they will
   behave portably across platforms. (#4453)
 - The subunit reporter now correctly reports import errors as errors,
   rather than by crashing with an unrelated error. (#4496)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - The finger tutorial example which introduces services now avoids
   double-starting the loop to re-read its users file. (#4420)
 - twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.callback's docstring now mentions

   when called before reactor.run, and there will be no potential for
   zombie processes in this case. (#2078)

 - High-throughput applications based on Perspective Broker should now
   run noticably faster thanks to the use of a more efficient decoding
   function in Twisted Spread. (#2310)

 - Documentation for trac-post-commit-hook functionality in svn-dev
   policy. (#3867)

 - twisted.protocols.socks.SOCKSv4 now supports the SOCKSv4a protocol.

   https://launchpad.net/subunit). (#4004)

 - twisted.protocols.amp now provides a ListOf argument type which can
   be composed with some other argument types to create a zero or more
   element sequence of that type. (#4116)

 - If returnValue is invoked outside of a function decorated with
   @inlineCallbacks, but causes a function thusly decorated to exit, a
   DeprecationWarning will be emitted explaining this potentially
   confusing behavior.  In a future release, this will cause an
   exception. (#4157)

   fixing a terrible infinite recursion bug that's only on edge case.
   (#3289)

 - Stringify non-string data to NetstringReceiver.sendString before
   calculating the length so that the calculated length is equal to
   the actual length of the transported data. (#3299)

 - twisted.python.win32.cmdLineQuote now correctly quotes empty
   strings arguments (#3876)

 - Change the behavior of the Gtk2Reactor to register only one source
   watch for each file descriptor, instead of one for reading and one
   for writing. In particular, it fixes a bug with Glib under Windows
   where we failed to notify when a client is connected. (#3925)

 - Twisted Trial no longer crashes if it can't remove an old
   _trial_temp directory.  (#4020)

 - The optional _c_urlarg extension now handles unquote("") correctly

 - On POSIX, child processes created with reactor.spawnProcess will no
   longer automatically ignore the signals which the parent process
   has set to be ignored. (#4199)

 - All SOCKSv4a tests now use a dummy reactor with a deterministic
   resolve method. (#4275)

 - Prevent extraneous server, date and content-type headers in proxy
   responses. (#4277)

 - The 'wsgi.input' WSGI environment object now supports -1 and None
   as arguments to the read and readlines methods. (#4114)

 - twisted.web.wsgi doesn't unquote QUERY_STRING anymore, thus
   complying with the WSGI reference implementation. (#4143)

 - The HTTP proxy will no longer pass on keep-alive request headers
   from the client, preventing pages from loading then "hanging"
   (leaving the connection open with no hope of termination). (#4179)

Twisted Conch 9.0.0 (2009-11-24)
================================

Fixes
-----
 - The SSH key parser has been removed and conch now uses pyASN1 to parse keys.
   This should fix a number of cases where parsing a key would fail, but it now
   requires users to have pyASN1 installed (#3391)

===============================

Features
--------
 - Python source listings now include line numbers (#3486)

Fixes
-----

   #1219)
 - A case where the SMTP client could skip some recipients when retrying

   correctly by the IMAP4 server protocol (#3659)
 - The "imap4-utf-7" codec that is registered by twisted.mail.imap4 had a number
   of fixes that allow it to work better with the Python codecs system, and to
   actually work (#3663)
 - The Maildir implementation now ensures time-based ordering of filenames so
   that the lexical sorting of messages matches the order in which they were
   received (#3812)

   (client and server) should now be RFC-compliant (#3939)
 - Searching for a set of sequences using the IMAP4 "SEARCH" command should

   (#3549, #3469)
 - When specifying a followRedirect argument to the getPage function, the state
   of redirect-following for other getPage calls should now be unaffected.  It

   sooner by the request when the connection is lost (#1621, #3176)
 - xmlrpclib.DateTime objects should now correctly round-trip over twisted.web's
   XMLRPC support in all supported versions of Python, and errors during error
   serialization will no longer hang a twisted.web XMLRPC response (#2446)
 - request.content should now always be seeked to the beginning when
   request.process is called, so application code should never need to seek 
   back manually (#3585)

   "example//foo.html") should now return a 404 instead of a traceback and
   500 error (#3631)
 - downloadPage will now fire a Failure on its returned Deferred instead of
   indicating success when the connection is prematurely lost (#3645)

 - The twisted.web WSGI support should now include leading slashes in PATH_INFO,
   and SCRIPT_NAME will be empty if the application is at the root of the
   resource tree. This means that WSGI applications should no longer generate

   (#3721)
 - WSGI applications should now receive the requesting client's IP in the
   REMOTE_ADDR environment variable (#3730)

   requested Range value doesn't fit entirely within the file's contents (#3814)
 - Attempting to call request.finish() after the connection has been lost will
   now immediately raise a RuntimeError (#4013)
 - An HTTP-auth resource should now be able to directly render the wrapped
   avatar, whereas before it would only allow retrieval of child resources
   (#4014)
 - twisted.web's wsgi support should no longer attempt to call request.finish
   twice, which would cause errors in certain cases (#4025)

   (#4029)
 - Exceptions raised from WSGI applications should now more reliably be turned
   into 500 errors on the HTTP level (#4019)

   Pidgin able to successfully connect to a twisted.words IRC server (#2385)
 - The IRC client will now dispatch "RPL MOTD" messages received before a
   "RPL MOTD START" instead of raising an exception (#3676)
