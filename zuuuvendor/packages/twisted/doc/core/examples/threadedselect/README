The examples in this directory import a private module from the
twisted.internet package.  The _threadedselect module provides an object
which is similar to a Twisted reactor in many ways, but which is not
actually intended to be used in the same way as a Twisted reactor (it has a
method named interleave which is intended to be the main entrypoint).  This
functionality should be considered highly experimental and the API subject
to change at any time.

Possibly the best way to make use of this functionality is to use it to
implement an object which actually presents the Twisted reactor interface
(specifically, an object with a run method).  That object can then be used
by application-code in the usual way.

Another course of action is to avoid _threadedselect entirely until the
issues surrounding it have been resolved.
