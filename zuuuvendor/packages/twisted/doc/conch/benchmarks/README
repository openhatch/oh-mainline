This directory contains various simple programs intended to exercise various
features of Twisted Conch as a way to learn about and track their
performance characteristics.  As there is currently no record of past
benchmark results, the tracking aspect of this is currently somewhat
fantastic.  However, the intent is for this to change at some future point.

All (one) of the programs in this directory are currently intended to be
invoked directly and to report some timing information on standard out.

The following benchmarks are currently available:

buffering_mixin.py:

    This deals with twisted.conch.mixin.BufferingMixin which provides
    Nagle-like write coalescing for Protocol classes.
