Requirements

  Python 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7; or, Python 2.4 on any non-Windows operating system.

  Zope Interfaces 3.3.0 or better (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface)

  pyOpenSSL (<http://launchpad.net/pyopenssl>) is required for any SSL APIs.  On
  Windows, version 0.10 or newer is required.  pyOpenSSL 0.10 or newer is also
  preferred on other platforms, but older versions will work as well.

  On Windows pywin32 (<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/>) is
  recommended (this is already included in ActivePython).  The Windows IOCP
  reactor requires pywin32 build 205 or later.

  If you would like to use Trial's subunit reporter, then you will need to
  install Subunit 0.0.2 or later (https://launchpad.net/subunit).
