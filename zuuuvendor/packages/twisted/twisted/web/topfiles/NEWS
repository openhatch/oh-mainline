Twisted Web 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web._newclient.HTTPParser (and therefore Agent) now handles
   HTTP headers delimited by bare LF newlines. (#3833)
 - twisted.web.client.downloadPage now accepts the `afterFoundGet`
   parameter, with the same meaning as the `getPage` parameter of the
   same name. (#4364)
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.Proxy constructor now takes additional 'timeout'
   and 'reactor' arguments. The 'timeout' argument defaults to 30
   seconds. (#4741)
 - Twisted Web now has a templating system, twisted.web.template,
   which is a direct, simplified derivative of Divmod Nevow. (#4939)

Bugfixes
--------
 - HTTPPageGetter now adds the port to the host header if it is not
   the default for that scheme. (#3857)
 - twisted.web.http.Request.write now raises an exception if it is
   called after response generation has already finished. (#4317)
 - twisted.web.client.HTTPPageGetter and twisted.web.client.getPage
   now no longer make two requests when using afterFoundGet. (#4760)
 - twisted.web.twcgi no longer adds an extra "content-type" header to
   CGI responses. (#4786)
 - twisted.web will now properly specify an encoding (UTF-8) on error,
   redirect, and directory listing pages, so that IE7 and previous
   will not improperly guess the 'utf7' encoding in these cases.
   Please note that Twisted still sets a *default* content-type of
   'text/html', and you shouldn't rely on that: you should set the
   encoding appropriately in your application. (#4900)
 - twisted.web.http.Request.setHost now sets the port in the host
   header if it is not the default. (#4918)
 - default NOT_IMPLEMENTED and NOT_ALLOWED pages now quote the request
   method and URI respectively, to protect against browsers which
   don't quote those values for us. (#4978)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - The XML-RPC howto now includes an example demonstrating how to
   access the HTTP request object in a server-side XML-RPC method.
   (#4732)
 - The Twisted Web client howto now uses the correct, public name for
   twisted.web.client.Response. (#4769)
 - Some broken links were fixed, descriptions were updated, and new
   API links were added in the Resource Templating documentation
   (resource-templates.xhtml) (#4968)

Other
-----
 - #2271, #2386, #4162, #4733, #4855, #4911, #4973


Twisted Web 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.XMLRPC.xmlrpc_* methods can now be decorated
   using withRequest to cause them to be passed the HTTP request
   object. (#3073)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.QueryProtocol.handleResponse now disconnects
   from the server, meaning that Twisted XML-RPC clients disconnect
   from the server as soon as they receive a response, rather than
   relying on the server to disconnect. (#2518)
 - twisted.web.twcgi now generates responses containing all
   occurrences of duplicate headers produced by CGI scripts, not just
   the last value. (#4742)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web.trp, which has been deprecated since Twisted 9.0, was
   removed. (#4299)

Other
-----
 - #4576, #4577, #4709, #4723


Twisted Web 10.1.0 (2010-06-27)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.XMLRPC and twisted.web.xmlrpc.Proxy now expose
   xmlrpclib's support of datetime.datetime objects if useDateTime is
   set to True. (#3219)
 - HTTP11ClientProtocol now has an abort() method for cancelling an
   outstanding request by closing the connection before receiving the
   entire response. (#3811)
 - twisted.web.http_headers.Headers initializer now rejects
   incorrectly structured dictionaries. (#4022)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now supports HTTPS URLs. (#4023)
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.Proxy.callRemote now returns a Deferred which
   can be cancelled to abort the attempted XML-RPC call. (#4377)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.guard now logs out avatars even if a request completes
   with an error. (#4411)
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.XMLRPC will now no longer trigger a RuntimeError
   by trying to write responses to closed connections. (#4423)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - Fix broken links to deliverBody and iweb.UNKNOWN_LENGTH in
   doc/web/howto/client.xhtml. (#4507)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web.twcgi.PHP3Script and twisted.web.twcgi.PHPScript are
   now deprecated. (#516)

Other
-----
 - #4403, #4452


Twisted Web 10.0.0 (2010-03-01)
===============================

Features
--------
 - Twisted Web in 60 Seconds, a series of short tutorials with self-
   contained examples on a range of common web topics, is now a part
   of the Twisted Web howto documentation. (#4192)

Bugfixes
--------
 - Data and File from twisted.web.static and
   twisted.web.distrib.UserDirectory will now only generate a 200
   response for GET or HEAD requests.
   twisted.web.client.HTTPPageGetter will no longer ignore the case of
   a request method when considering whether to apply special HEAD
   processing to a response. (#446)

 - twisted.web.http.HTTPClient now supports multi-line headers.
   (#2062)

 - Resources served via twisted.web.distrib will no longer encounter a
   Banana error when writing more than 640kB at once to the request
   object. (#3212)

 - The Error, PageRedirect, and InfiniteRedirection exception in
   twisted.web now initialize an empty message parameter by mapping
   the HTTP status code parameter to a descriptive string. Previously
   the lookup would always fail, leaving message empty.  (#3806)

 - The 'wsgi.input' WSGI environment object now supports -1 and None
   as arguments to the read and readlines methods. (#4114)

 - twisted.web.wsgi doesn't unquote QUERY_STRING anymore, thus
   complying with the WSGI reference implementation. (#4143)

 - The HTTP proxy will no longer pass on keep-alive request headers
   from the client, preventing pages from loading then "hanging"
   (leaving the connection open with no hope of termination). (#4179)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - Remove '--static' option from twistd web, that served as an alias
   for the '--path' option. (#3907)

Other
-----
 - #3784, #4216, #4242


Twisted Web 9.0.0 (2009-11-24)
==============================

Features

 - downloadPage now supports the same cookie, redirect, and timeout features
   that getPage supports (#2971)
 - A chapter about WSGI has been added to the twisted.web documentation (#3510)
 - The HTTP auth support in the web server now allows anonymous sessions by
   logging in with ANONYMOUS credentials when no Authorization header is
   provided in a request (#3924, #3936)
 - HTTPClientFactory now accepts a parameter to enable a common deviation from
   the HTTP 1.1 standard by responding to redirects in a POSTed request with a
   GET instead of another POST (#3624)
 - A new basic HTTP/1.1 client API is included in twisted.web.client.Agent
   (#886, #3987)

Fixes
-----
 - Requests for "insecure" children of a static.File (such as paths containing
   encoded directory separators) will now result in a 404 instead of a 500
   (#3549, #3469)
 - When specifying a followRedirect argument to the getPage function, the state
   of redirect-following for other getPage calls should now be unaffected.  It
   was previously overwriting a class attribute which would affect outstanding
   getPage calls (#3192)
 - Downloading an URL of the form "http://example.com:/" will now work,
   ignoring the extraneous colon (#2402)
 - microdom's appendChild method will no longer issue a spurious warning, and
   microdom's methods in general should now issue more meaningful exceptions
   when invalid parameters are passed (#3421)
 - WSGI applications will no longer have spurious Content-Type headers added to
   their responses by the twisted.web server. In addition, WSGI applications
   will no longer be able to specify the server-restricted headers Server and
   Date (#3569)
 - http_headers.Headers now normalizes the case of raw headers passed directly
   to it in the same way that it normalizes the headers passed to setRawHeaders
   (#3557)
 - The distrib module no longer relies on the deprecated woven package (#3559)
 - twisted.web.domhelpers now works with both microdom and minidom (#3600)
 - twisted.web servers will now ignore invalid If-Modified-Since headers instead
   of returning a 500 error (#3601)
 - Certain request-bound memory and file resources are cleaned up slightly
   sooner by the request when the connection is lost (#1621, #3176)
 - xmlrpclib.DateTime objects should now correctly round-trip over twisted.web's
   XMLRPC support in all supported versions of Python, and errors during error
   serialization will no longer hang a twisted.web XMLRPC response (#2446)
 - request.content should now always be seeked to the beginning when
   request.process is called, so application code should never need to seek 
   back manually (#3585)
 - Fetching a child of static.File with a double-slash in the URL (such as
   "example//foo.html") should now return a 404 instead of a traceback and
   500 error (#3631)
 - downloadPage will now fire a Failure on its returned Deferred instead of
   indicating success when the connection is prematurely lost (#3645)
 - static.File will now provide a 404 instead of a 500 error when it was
   constructed with a non-existent file (#3634)
 - microdom should now serialize namespaces correctly (#3672)
 - The HTTP Auth support resource wrapper should no longer corrupt requests and
   cause them to skip a segment in the request path (#3679)
 - The twisted.web WSGI support should now include leading slashes in PATH_INFO,
   and SCRIPT_NAME will be empty if the application is at the root of the
   resource tree. This means that WSGI applications should no longer generate
   URLs with double-slashes in them even if they naively concatenate the values
   (#3721)
 - WSGI applications should now receive the requesting client's IP in the
   REMOTE_ADDR environment variable (#3730)
 - The distrib module should work again. It was unfortunately broken with the
   refactoring of twisted.web's header support (#3697)
 - static.File now supports multiple ranges specified in the Range header
   (#3574)
 - static.File should now generate a correct Content-Length value when the
   requested Range value doesn't fit entirely within the file's contents (#3814)
 - Attempting to call request.finish() after the connection has been lost will
   now immediately raise a RuntimeError (#4013)
 - An HTTP-auth resource should now be able to directly render the wrapped
   avatar, whereas before it would only allow retrieval of child resources
   (#4014)
 - twisted.web's wsgi support should no longer attempt to call request.finish
   twice, which would cause errors in certain cases (#4025)
 - WSGI applications should now be able to handle requests with large bodies
   (#4029)
 - Exceptions raised from WSGI applications should now more reliably be turned
   into 500 errors on the HTTP level (#4019)
 - DeferredResource now correctly passes through exceptions raised from the
   wrapped resource, instead of turning them all into 500 errors (#3932)
 - Agent.request now generates a Host header when no headers are passed at
   (#4131)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - The unmaintained and untested twisted.web.monitor module was removed (#2763)
 - The twisted.web.woven package has been removed (#1522)
 - All of the error resources in twisted.web.error are now in
   twisted.web.resource, and accessing them through twisted.web.error is now
   deprecated (#3035)

   various things have been deprecated (#3457)
   - the loopFactory attribute is now ignored
   - the checkExpired method now does nothing
   - the lifetime parameter to startCheckingExpiration is now ignored
