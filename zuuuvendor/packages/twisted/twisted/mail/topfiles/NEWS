Twisted Mail 9.0.0 (2009-11-24)
===============================

Features
--------
 - maildir.StringListMailbox, an in-memory maildir mailbox, now supports
   deletion, undeletion, and syncing (#3547)
 - SMTPClient's callbacks are now more completely documented (#684)

Fixes
-----
 - Parse UNSEEN response data and include it in the result of
   IMAP4Client.examine (#3550)
 - The IMAP4 client now delivers more unsolicited server responses to callbacks
   rather than ignoring them, and also won't ignore solicited responses that
   arrive on the same line as an unsolicited one (#1105)

   #1219)
 - A case where the SMTP client could skip some recipients when retrying
   delivery has been fixed (#3638)
 - Errors during certain data transfers will no longer be swallowed. They will
   now bubble up to the higher-level API (such as the sendmail function) (#3642)
 - Escape sequences inside quoted strings in IMAP4 should now be parsed
   correctly by the IMAP4 server protocol (#3659)
 - The "imap4-utf-7" codec that is registered by twisted.mail.imap4 had a number
   of fixes that allow it to work better with the Python codecs system, and to
   actually work (#3663)
 - The Maildir implementation now ensures time-based ordering of filenames so
   that the lexical sorting of messages matches the order in which they were
   received (#3812)

   (client and server) should now be RFC-compliant (#3939)
 - Searching for a set of sequences using the IMAP4 "SEARCH" command should 
   now work on the IMAP4 server protocol implementation. This at least improves
   support for the Pine mail client (#1977)

   server, to support the AUTH <mechanism>
