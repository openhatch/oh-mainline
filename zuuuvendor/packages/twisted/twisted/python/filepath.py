        Replace the file at this path with a new file that contains the given

        On UNIX-like platforms, this method does its best to ensure that by the
        time this method returns, either the old contents I{or} the new contents
        of the file will be present at this path for subsequent readers
        regardless of premature device removal, program crash, or power loss,
        making the following assumptions:

            - your filesystem is journaled (i.e. your filesystem will not
              I{itself} lose data due to power loss)

            - your filesystem's C{rename()} is atomic

            - your filesystem will not discard new data while preserving new
              metadata (see U{http://mjg59.livejournal.com/108257.html} for more
              detail)

        On most versions of Windows there is no atomic C{rename()} (see
        U{http://bit.ly/win32-overwrite} for more information), so this method
        is slightly less helpful.  There is a small window where the file at
        this path may be deleted before the new file is moved to replace it:
        however, the new file will be fully written and flushed beforehand so in
        the unlikely event that there is a crash at that point, it should be
        possible for the user to manually recover the new version of their data.
        In the future, Twisted will support atomic file moves on those versions
        of Windows which I{do} support them: see U{Twisted ticket
        3004<http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3004>}.

        This method should be safe for use by multiple concurrent processes, but
