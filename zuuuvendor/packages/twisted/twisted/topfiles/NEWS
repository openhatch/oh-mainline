Twisted Core 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
================================

Features
--------
 - The reactor is not restartable, but it would previously fail to
   complain. Now, when you restart an unrestartable reactor, you get
   an exception. (#2066)
 - twisted.plugin now only emits a short log message, rather than a
   full traceback, if there is a problem writing out the dropin cache
   file. (#2409)
 - Added a 'replacement' parameter to the
   'twisted.python.deprecate.deprecated' decorator.  This allows
   deprecations to unambiguously specify what they have been
   deprecated in favor of. (#3047)
 - Added access methods to FilePath for FilePath.statinfo's st_ino,
   st_dev, st_nlink, st_uid, and st_gid fields.  This is in
   preparation for the deprecation of FilePath.statinfo. (#4712)
 - IPv4Address and UNIXAddress now have a __hash__ method. (#4783)
 - twisted.protocols.ftp.FTP.ftp_STOR now catches `FTPCmdError`s
   raised by the file writer, and returns the error back to the
   client. (#4909)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twistd will no longer fail if a non-root user passes --uid 'myuid'
   as a command-line argument. Instead, it will emit an error message.
   (#3172)
 - IOCPReactor now sends immediate completions to the main loop
   (#3233)
 - trial can now load test methods from multiple classes, even if the
   methods all happen to be inherited from the same base class.
   (#3383)
 - twisted.web.server will now produce a correct Allow header when a
   particular render_FOO method is missing. (#3678)
 - HEAD requests made to resources whose HEAD handling defaults to
   calling render_GET now always receive a response with no body.
   (#3684)
 - trial now loads decorated test methods whether or not the decorator
   preserves the original method name. (#3909)
 - t.p.amp.AmpBox.serialize will now correctly consistently complain
   when being fed Unicode. (#3931)
 - twisted.internet.wxreactor now supports stopping more reliably.
   (#3948)
 - reactor.spawnProcess on Windows can now handle ASCII-encodable
   Unicode strings in the system environment (#3964)
 - When C-extensions are not complied for twisted, on python2.4, skip
   a test in twisted.internet.test.test_process that may hang due to a
   SIGCHLD related problem. Running 'python setup.py build_ext
   --inplace' will compile the extension and cause the test to both
   run and pass. (#4331)
 - twisted.python.logfile.LogFile now raises a descriptive exception
   when passed a log  directoy which does not exist. (#4701)
 - Fixed a bug where Inotify will fail to add a filepatch to watchlist
   after it has been added/ignored previously. (#4708)
 - IPv4Address and UNIXAddress object comparison operators fixed
   (#4817)
 - twisted.internet.task.Clock now sorts the list of pending calls
   before and after processing each call (#4823)
 - ConnectionLost is now in twisted.internet.error.__all__ instead of
   twisted.words.protocols.jabber.xmlstream.__all__. (#4856)
 - twisted.internet.process now detects the most appropriate mechanism
   to use for detecting the open file descriptors on a system, getting
   Twisted working on FreeBSD even when fdescfs is not mounted.
   (#4881)
 - twisted.words.services referenced nonexistent
   twisted.words.protocols.irc.IRC_NOSUCHCHANNEL. This has been fixed.
   Related code has also received test cases. (#4915)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - The INSTALL file now lists all of Twisted's dependencies. (#967)
 - Added the stopService and startService methods to all finger
   example files. (#3375)
 - Missing reactor.run() calls were added in the UDP and client howto
   documents. (#3834)
 - The maxRetries attribute of
   twisted.internet.protocols.RetryingClientFactory now has API
   documentation. (#4618)
 - Lore docs pointed to a template that no longer existed, this has
   been fixed. (#4682)
 - The `servers` argument to `twisted.names.client.createResolver` now
   has more complete API documentation. (#4713)
 - Linked to the Twisted endpoints tutorial from the Twisted core
   howto list.  (#4773)
 - The Endpoints howto now links to the API documentation. (#4774)
 - The Quotes howto is now more clear in its PYTHONPATH setup
   instructions. (#4785)
 - The API documentation for DeferredList's fireOnOneCallback
   parameter now gives the correct order of the elements of the result
   tuple. (#4882)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - returning a value other than None from IProtocol.dataReceived was
   deprecated (#2491)
 - Deprecated the --extra option in trial.  (#3372)
 - twisted.protocols._c_urlarg has been removed. (#4162)
 - Remove the --report-profile option for twistd, deprecated since
   2007. (#4236)
 - Deprecated twisted.persisted.journal.  This library is no longer
   maintained.  (#4298)
 - Removed twisted.protocols.loopback.loopback, which has been
   deprecated since Twisted 2.5. (#4547)
 - __getitem__ __getslice__ and __eq__ (tuple comparison, indexing)
   removed from twisted.internet.address.IPv4Address and
   twisted.internet.address.UNIXAddress classes UNIXAddress and
   IPv4Address properties _bwHack are now deprecated in
   twisted.internet.address (#4817)
 - twisted.python.reflect.allYourBase is now no longer used, replaced
   with inspect.getmro (#4928)
 - allYourBase and accumulateBases are now deprecated in favor of
   inspect.getmro. (#4946)

Twisted Core 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
================================

Features
--------
 - twisted.internet.cfreactor has been significantly improved.  It now
   runs, and passes, the test suite.  Many, many bugs in it have been
   fixed, including several segfaults, as it now uses PyObjC and
   longer requires C code in Twisted. (#1833)
 - twisted.protocols.ftp.FTPRealm now accepts a parameter to override
   "/home" as the container for user directories.  The new
   BaseFTPRealm class in the same module also allows easy
   implementation of custom user directory schemes. (#2179)
 - twisted.python.filepath.FilePath and twisted.python.zippath.ZipPath
   now have a descendant method to simplify code which calls the child
   method repeatedly. (#3169)
 - twisted.python.failure._Frame objects now support fake f_locals
   attribute. (#4045)
 - twisted.internet.endpoints now has 'serverFromString' and
   'clientFromString' APIs for constructing endpoints from descriptive
   strings. (#4473)
 - The default trial reporter now combines reporting of tests with the
   same result to shorten its summary output. (#4487)
 - The new class twisted.protocols.ftp.SystemFTPRealm implements an
   FTP realm which uses system accounts to select home directories.
   (#4494)
 - twisted.internet.reactor.spawnProcess now wastes less time trying
   to close non-existent file descriptors on POSIX platforms. (#4522)
 - twisted.internet.win32eventreactor now declares that it implements
   a new twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorWin32Events interface.
   (#4523)
 - twisted.application.service.IProcess now documents its attributes
   using zope.interface.Attribute. (#4534)
 - twisted.application.app.ReactorSelectionMixin now saves the value
   of the --reactor option in the "reactor" key of the options object.
   (#4563)
 - twisted.internet.endpoints.serverFromString and clientFromString,
   and therefore also twisted.application.strports.service, now
   support plugins, so third parties may implement their own endpoint
   types. (#4695)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.internet.defer.Deferred now handles chains iteratively
   instead of recursively, preventing RuntimeError due to excessive
   recursion when handling long Deferred chains. (#411)
 - twisted.internet.cfreactor now works with trial. (#2556)
 - twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool.close may now be called
   even if the connection pool has not yet been started.  This will
   prevent the pool from ever starting. (#2680)
 - twisted.protocols.basic.NetstringReceiver raises
   NetstringParseErrors for  invalid netstrings now. It handles empty
   netstrings ("0:,") correctly, and  the performance for receiving
   netstrings has been improved. (#4378)
 - reactor.listenUDP now returns an object which declares that it
   implements IListeningPort. (#4462)
 - twisted.python.randbytes no longer uses PyCrypto as a secure random
   number source (since it is not one). (#4468)
 - twisted.internet.main.installReactor now blocks installation of
   another reactor when using python -O (#4476)
 - twisted.python.deprecate.deprecatedModuleAttribute now emits only
   one warning when used to deprecate a package attribute which is a
   module. (#4492)
 - The "brief" mode of twisted.python.failure.Failure.getTraceback now
   handles exceptions raised by the underlying exception's __str__
   method. (#4501)
 - twisted.words.xish.domish now correctly parses XML with namespaces
   which include whitespace. (#4503)
 - twisted.names.authority.FileAuthority now generates correct
   negative caching hints, marks its referral NS RRs as non-
   authoritative, and correctly generates referrals for ALL_RECORDS
   requests. (#4513)
 - twisted.internet.test.reactormixins.ReactorBuilder's attribute
   `requiredInterface` (which should an interface) is now
   `requiredInterfaces` (a list of interfaces) as originally described
   per the documentation. (#4527)
 - twisted.python.zippath.ZipPath.__repr__ now correctly formats paths
   with ".." in them (by including it). (#4535)
 - twisted.names.hosts.searchFileFor has been fixed against
   refcounting dependency. (#4540)
 - The POSIX process transports now declare that they implement
   IProcessTransport. (#4585)
 - Twisted can now be built with the LLVM clang compiler, with
   'CC=clang python setup.py build'.  C code that caused errors with
   this compiler has been removed. (#4652)
 - trial now puts coverage data in the path specified by --temp-
   directory, even if that option comes after --coverage on the
   command line. (#4657)
 - The unregisterProducer method of connection-oriented transports
   will now cause the connection to be closed if there was a prior
   call to loseConnection. (#4719)
 - Fixed an issue where the new StreamServerEndpointService didn't log
   listen errors.  (This was a bug not present in any previous
   releases, as this class is new.) (#4731)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - The trial man page now documents the meaning of the final line of
   output of the default reporter. (#1384)
 - The API documentation for twisted.internet.defer.DeferredList now
   goes into more depth about the effects each of the __init__ flags
   that class accepts. (#3595)
 - There is now narrative documentation for the endpoints APIs, in the
   'endpoints' core howto, as well as modifications to the 'writing
   clients' and 'writing servers' core howto documents to indicate
   that endpoints are now the preferred style of listening and
   connecting. (#4478)
 - trial's man page now documents the --disablegc option in more
   detail. (#4511)
 - trial's coverage output format is now documented in the trial man
   page. (#4512)
 - Broken links and spelling errors in the finger tutorial are now
   fixed. (#4516)
 - twisted.internet.threads.blockingCallFromThread's docstring is now
   explicit about Deferred support. (#4517)
 - twisted.python.zippath.ZipPath.child now documents its handling of
   ".." (which is not special, making it different from
   FilePath.child). (#4535)
 - The API docs for twisted.internet.defer.Deferred now cover several
   more of its (less interesting) attributes. (#4538)
 - LineReceiver, NetstringReceiver, and IntNStringReceiver from
   twisted.protocols.basic now have improved API documentation for
   read callbacks and write methods. (#4542)
 - Tidied up the Twisted Conch documentation for easier conversion.
   (#4566)
 - Use correct Twisted version for when cancellation was introduced in
   the Deferred docstring. (#4614)
 - The logging howto is now more clear about how the standard library
   logging module and twisted.python.log can be integrated. (#4642)
 - The finger tutorial still had references to .tap files. This
   reference has now been removed. The documentation clarifies
   "finger.tap" is a module and not a filename. (#4679)
 - The finger tutorial had a broken link to the
   twisted.application.service.Service class, which is now fixed.
   Additionally, a minor typo ('verison') was fixed.  (#4681)
 - twisted.protocols.policies.TimeoutMixin now has clearer API
   documentation. (#4684)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.setTimeout has been removed, after
   being deprecated since Twisted 2.0. (#1702)
 - twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorTime.cancelCallLater
   (deprecated since  2007) and
   twisted.internet.interfaces.base.ReactorBase.cancelCallLater
   (deprecated since 2002) have been removed. (#4076)
 - Removed twisted.cred.util.py, which has been deprecated since
   Twisted 8.3. (#4107)
 - twisted.python.text.docstringLStrip was deprecated. (#4328)
 - The module attributes `LENGTH`, `DATA`, `COMMA`, and `NUMBER` of
   twisted.protocols.basic (previously used by `NetstringReceiver`)
   are now deprecated. (#4541)
 - twisted.protocols.basic.SafeNetstringReceiver, deprecated since
   2001 (before Twisted 2.0), was removed. (#4546)
 - twisted.python.threadable.whenThreaded, deprecated since Twisted
   2.2.0, has been removed. (#4550)
 - twisted.python.timeoutqueue, deprecated since Twisted 8.0, has been
   removed. (#4551)
 - iocpreactor transports can no longer be pickled. (#4617)

Twisted Core 10.1.0 (2010-06-27)
================================

Features
--------
 - Add linux inotify support, allowing monitoring of file system
   events. (#972)
 - Deferreds now support cancellation. (#990)
 - Added new "endpoint" interfaces in twisted.internet.interfaces,
   which abstractly describe stream transport endpoints which can be
   listened on or connected to.  Implementations for TCP and SSL
   clients and servers are present in twisted.internet.endpoints.
   Notably, client endpoints' connect() methods return cancellable
   Deferreds, so code written to use them can bypass the awkward
   "ClientFactory.clientConnectionFailed" and
   "Connector.stopConnecting" methods, and handle errbacks from or
   cancel the returned deferred, respectively. (#1442)
 - twisted.protocols.amp.Integer's documentation now clarifies that
   integers of arbitrary size are supported and that the wire format
   is a base-10 representation. (#2650)
 - twisted.protocols.amp now includes support for transferring
   timestamps (amp.DateTime) and decimal values (amp.Decimal). (#2651)
 - twisted.protocol.ftp.IWriteFile now has a close() method, which can
   return a Deferred. Previously a STOR command would finish
   immediately upon the receipt of the last byte of the uploaded file.
   With close(), the backend can delay the finish until it has
   performed some other slow action (like storing the data to a
   virtual filesystem). (#3462)
 - FilePath now calls os.stat() only when new status information is
   required, rather than immediately when anything changes.  For some
   applications this may result in fewer stat() calls.  Additionally,
   FilePath has a new method, 'changed', which applications may use to
   indicate that the FilePath may have been changed on disk and
   therefore the next status information request must  fetch a new
   stat result.  This is useful if external systems, such as C
   libraries, may have changed files that Twisted applications are
   referencing via a FilePath. (#4130)
 - Documentation improvements are now summarized in the NEWS file.
   (#4224)
 - twisted.internet.task.deferLater now returns a cancellable
   Deferred. (#4318)
 - The connect methods of twisted.internet.protocol.ClientCreator now
   return cancellable Deferreds. (#4329)
 - twisted.spread.pb now has documentation covering some of its
   limitations. (#4402)
 - twisted.spread.jelly now supports jellying and unjellying classes
   defined with slots if they also implement __getstate__ and
   __setstate__. (#4430)
 - twisted.protocols.amp.ListOf arguments can now be specified as
   optional. (#4474)

Bugfixes
--------
 - On POSIX platforms, reactors now support child processes in a way
   which doesn't cause other syscalls to sometimes fail with EINTR (if
   running on Python 2.6 or if Twisted's extension modules have been
   built). (#733)
 - Substrings are escaped before being passed to a regular expression
   for searching to ensure that they don't get interpreted as part of
   the expression. (#1893)
 - twisted.internet.stdio now supports stdout being redirected to a
   normal file (except when using epollreactor). (#2259)
 -  (#2367)
 - The tap2rpm script now works with modern versions of RPM. (#3292)
 - twisted.python.modules.walkModules will now handle packages
   explicitly precluded from importing by a None placed in
   sys.modules. (#3419)
 - ConnectedDatagramPort now uses stopListening when a connection
   fails instead of the deprecated loseConnection. (#3425)
 - twisted.python.filepath.FilePath.setContent is now safe for
   multiple processes to use concurrently. (#3694)
 - The mode argument to the methods of
   twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorUNIX is no longer deprecated.
   (#4078)
 - Do not include blacklisted projects when generating NEWS. (#4190)
 - When generating NEWS for a project that had no significant changes,
   include a section for that project and say that there were no
   interesting changes. (#4191)
 - Redundant 'b' mode is no longer passed to calls to FilePath.open
   and FilePath.open itself now corrects the mode when multiple 'b'
   characters are present, ensuring only one instance of 'b' is
   provided, as a workaround for http://bugs.python.org/issue7686.
   (#4207)
 - HTML tags inside <pre> tags in the code snippets are now escaped.
   (#4336)
 - twisted.protocols.amp.CommandLocator now allows subclasses to
   override responders inherited from base classes. (#4343)
 - Fix a bunch of small but important defects in the INSTALL, README
   and so forth. (#4346)
 - The poll, epoll, glib2, and gtk2 reactors now all support half-
   close in the twisted.internet.stdio.StandardIO transport. (#4352)
 - twisted.application.internet no longer generates an extra and
   invalid entry in its __all__ list for the nonexistent
   MulticastClient. (#4373)
 - Choosing a reactor documentation now says that only the select-
   based reactor is a truly cross-platform reactor. (#4384)
 - twisted.python.filepath.FilePath now no longer leaves files open,
   to be closed by the garbage collector, when an exception is raised
   in the implementation of setContent, getContent, or copyTo. (#4400)
 - twisted.test.proto_helpers.StringTransport's getHost and getPeer
   methods now return IPv4Address instances by default. (#4401)
 - twisted.protocols.amp.BinaryBoxProtocol will no longer deliver an
   empty string to a switched-to protocol's dataReceived method when
   the BinaryBoxProtocol's buffer happened to be empty at the time of
   the protocol switch. (#4405)
 - IReactorUNIX.listenUNIX implementations now support abstract
   namespace sockets on Linux. (#4421)
 - Files opened with FilePath.create() (and therefore also files
   opened via FilePath.open() on a path with alwaysCreate=True) will
   now be opened in binary mode as advertised, so that they will
   behave portably across platforms. (#4453)
 - The subunit reporter now correctly reports import errors as errors,
   rather than by crashing with an unrelated error. (#4496)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - The finger tutorial example which introduces services now avoids
   double-starting the loop to re-read its users file. (#4420)
 - twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.callback's docstring now mentions
   the implicit chaining feature. (#4439)
 - doc/core/howto/listing/pb/chatclient.py can now actually send a
   group message. (#4459)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorArbitrary,
   twisted.application.internet.GenericServer, and
   twisted.application.internet.GenericClient are now deprecated.
   (#367)
 - twisted.internet.gtkreactor is now deprecated. (#2833)
 - twisted.trial.util.findObject has been deprecated. (#3108)
 - twisted.python.threadpool.ThreadSafeList is deprecated and Jython
   platform detection in Twisted core removed (#3725)
 - twisted.internet.interfaces.IUDPConnectedTransport has been removed
   (deprecated since Twisted 9.0). (#4077)
 - Removed twisted.application.app.runWithProfiler, which has been
   deprecated since Twisted 8.0. (#4090)
 - Removed twisted.application.app.runWithHotshot, which has been
   deprecated since Twisted 8.0. (#4091)
 - Removed twisted.application.app.ApplicationRunner.startLogging,
   which has been deprecated (doesn't say since when), as well as
   support for the legacy
   twisted.application.app.ApplicationRunner.getLogObserver method.
   (#4092)
 - twisted.application.app.reportProfile has been removed. (#4093)
 - twisted.application.app.getLogFile has been removed. (#4094)
 - Removed twisted.cred.util.py, which has been deprecated since
   Twisted 8.3. (#4107)
 - twisted.python.util.dsu is now deprecated. (#4339)
 - In twisted.trial.util: FailureError, DirtyReactorWarning,
   DirtyReactorError, and PendingTimedCallsError, which have all been
   deprecated since Twisted 8.0, have been removed. (#4505)

Twisted Core 10.0.0 (2010-03-01)
================================

Features
--------
 - The twistd man page now has a SIGNALS section. (#689)

 - reactor.spawnProcess now will not emit a PotentialZombieWarning
   when called before reactor.run, and there will be no potential for
   zombie processes in this case. (#2078)

 - High-throughput applications based on Perspective Broker should now
   run noticably faster thanks to the use of a more efficient decoding
   function in Twisted Spread. (#2310)

 - Documentation for trac-post-commit-hook functionality in svn-dev
   policy. (#3867)

 - twisted.protocols.socks.SOCKSv4 now supports the SOCKSv4a protocol.
   (#3886)

 - Trial can now output test results according to the subunit
   protocol, as long as Subunit is installed (see
   https://launchpad.net/subunit). (#4004)

 - twisted.protocols.amp now provides a ListOf argument type which can
   be composed with some other argument types to create a zero or more
   element sequence of that type. (#4116)

 - If returnValue is invoked outside of a function decorated with
   @inlineCallbacks, but causes a function thusly decorated to exit, a
   DeprecationWarning will be emitted explaining this potentially
   confusing behavior.  In a future release, this will cause an
   exception. (#4157)

 - twisted.python.logfile.BaseLogFile now has a reopen method allowing
   you to use an external logrotate mechanism. (#4255)

Bugfixes
--------
 - FTP.ftp_NLST now handles requests on invalid paths in a way
   consistent with RFC 959. (#1342)

 - twisted.python.util.initgroups now calls the low-level C initgroups
   by default if available: the python version can create lots of I/O
   with certain authentication setup to retrieve all the necessary
   information. (#3226)

 - startLogging now does nothing on subsequent invocations, thus
   fixing a terrible infinite recursion bug that's only on edge case.
   (#3289)

 - Stringify non-string data to NetstringReceiver.sendString before
   calculating the length so that the calculated length is equal to
   the actual length of the transported data. (#3299)

 - twisted.python.win32.cmdLineQuote now correctly quotes empty
   strings arguments (#3876)

 - Change the behavior of the Gtk2Reactor to register only one source
   watch for each file descriptor, instead of one for reading and one
   for writing. In particular, it fixes a bug with Glib under Windows
   where we failed to notify when a client is connected. (#3925)

 - Twisted Trial no longer crashes if it can't remove an old
   _trial_temp directory.  (#4020)

 - The optional _c_urlarg extension now handles unquote("") correctly
   on platforms where malloc(0) returns NULL, such as AIX.  It also
   compiles with less warnings. (#4142)

 - On POSIX, child processes created with reactor.spawnProcess will no
   longer automatically ignore the signals which the parent process
   has set to be ignored. (#4199)

 - All SOCKSv4a tests now use a dummy reactor with a deterministic
   resolve method. (#4275)

 - Prevent extraneous server, date and content-type headers in proxy
   responses. (#4277)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.internet.error.PotentialZombieWarning is now deprecated.
   (#2078)

 - twisted.test.time_helpers is now deprecated. (#3719)

 - The deprecated connectUDP method of IReactorUDP has now been
   removed. (#4075)

 - twisted.trial.unittest.TestCase now ignores the previously
   deprecated setUpClass and tearDownClass methods. (#4175)

2.5.0 (2006-12-29)
==================

Twisted 2.5.0 is a major feature release, with several interesting new
developments and a great number of bug fixes. Some of the highlights
follow.

 * AMP, the Asynchronous Messaging Protocol, was introduced.  AMP is
   a protocol which provides request/response semantics over a
   persistent connection in a very simple and extensible manner.

 * An Epoll-based reactor was added, which can be used with twistd or
   trial by passing "-r epoll" on the command line. This may improve
   performance of certain high-traffic network applications.

 * The 'twistd' command can now accept sub-commands which name an
   application to run. For example, 'twistd web --path .' will start a
   web server serving files out of the current directory. This
   functionality is meant to replace the old way of doing things with
   'mktap' and 'twistd -f'.

 * Python 2.5 is now supported. Previous releases of Twisted were
   broken by changes in the release of Python 2.5.

 * 'inlineCallbacks' was added, which allows taking advantage of the
   new 'yield' expression syntax in Python 2.5 to avoid writing
   callbacks for Deferreds.

In addition to these changes, there are many other minor features and
a large number of bug fixes.

Fixes
-----
 - Errors in UDP protocols no longer unbind the UDP port (#1695).
 - Misc: #1717, #1705, #1563, #1719, #1721, #1722, #1728.


2.3.0 (2006-05-14)
==================

Features
--------
 - twisted-dev-mode's F9 now uses trial's --testmodule feature, rather than
   trying to guess what tests to run.  This will break files using the "-x"
   test-case-name hack (just use a comma separated list instead).
 - API Documentation improvements.
 - A new Producer/Consumer guide (#53)
 - Better-defined error behavior in IReactorMulticast (#1578)
 - IOCP Multicast support (#1500)
 - Improved STDIO support on Windows. (#1553)

   Deferred has fired before rescheduling the next call (#1487)
 - Added twisted.python.versions.Version, a structured representation
   of Version information, including support for SVN revision numbers
   (#1663)

Fixes
-----

 - Many trial fixes, as usual 
 - All API documentation is now correctly formatted as epytext (#1545)
 - twisted.python.filepath.FilePath.__repr__ is safer.
 - Fix trial's "until-failure" mode. (#1453)
 - deferredGenerator now no longer causes handled exceptions (or
   results) to propagate to the resulting Deferred (#1709).
 - Misc: #1483, #1495, #1503, #1532, #1539, #1559, #1509, #1538,
   #1571, #1331, #1561, #737, #1562, #1573, #1594, #1607, #1407, #1615,
   #1645, #1634, #1620, #1664, #1666, #1650, #1670, #1675, #1692, #1710,
   #1668.

Deprecations
------------

 - Removal of already-deprecated trial APIs: the assertions module,
   util.deferredResult, util.deferredError, util.fireWhenDoneFunc,
   util.spinUntil, util.spinWhile, util.extract_tb,
   util.format_exception, util.suppress_warnings, unittest.wait,
   util.wait
 - The backwards compatibility layer of twisted.python.components
   (e.g., backwardsCompatImplements, fixClassImplements, etc) has been
   disabled. The functions still exist, but do nothing as to not break
   user code outright (#1511)
 - Deprecate the usage of the 'default' argument as a keyword argument
   in Interface.__call__. Passing a second positional argument to
   specify the default return value of the adaptation is still
   supported.


2.2.0 (2006-02-12)
==================

Features
--------
 - Twisted no longer works with Python 2.2
 - FTP server supports more clients
 - Process support on Windows
 - twisted.internet.stdio improved (including Windows support!)
 - Trial:
   - Continued Trial refactoring
   - Default trial reporter is verbose black&white when color isn't supported
   - Deferreds returned in trial tests that don't fire before the
     unittest timeout now have their errback fired with a TimeoutError
   - raising SkipTest in setUp and setUpClass skips tests
   - Test suites are failed if there are import errors

Fixes
-----
 - iocpreactor fixes
 - Threadpool fixes
 - Fixed infinite loops in datagramReceived edge cases
 - Issues resolved: 654, 773, 998, 1005, 1008, 1116, 1123, 1198, 1221,
   1232, 1233, 1236, 1240, 1244, 1258, 1263, 1265, 1266, 1271, 1275,
   1293, 1294, 1298, 1308, 1316, 1317, 1321, 1341, 1344, 1353, 1359,
   1372, 1374, 1377, 1379, 1380, 1385, 1388, 1389, 1413, 1422, 1426,
   1434, 1435, 1448, 1449, 1456

Deprecations
------------
 - Trial:
   - spinWhile and spinUntil
   - util.wait
   - extract_tb and format_exception
   - util.suppressWarnings
   - runReactor is gone


2.1.0 (2005-11-06)
==================

Features
--------
 - threadedselectreactor, a reactor which potentially makes
   integration with foreign event loops much simpler.
 - major improvements to twisted.conch.insults, including many new widgets.
 - adbapi ConnectionPools now have 'runWithConnection' which is
   similar to runInteraction but gives you a connection object instead of
   a transaction. [975]
 - __file__ is now usable in tac files
 - twisted.cred.pamauth now contains a PAM checker (moved from twisted.conch)
 - twisted.protocols.policies.LimitTotalConnectionsFactory now exists,
   which does as the name suggests
 - twisted.protocols.ident now uses /proc/net/tcp on Linux [233]
 - trial now recurses packages by default (a la the old -R parameter)
 - (PB) Calling a remote method that doesn't exist now raises
   NoSuchMethod instead of AttributeError.

Fixes
-----
 - FTP client and server improvements
 - Trial improvements: The code is now much simpler, and more stable.
 - twisted.protocols.basic.FileSender now works with empty files 
 - Twisted should now be much more usable on Pythons without thread support.
 - minor improvements to process code in win32eventreactor
 - twistd -y (--python) now implies -o (--nosave). [539]
 - improved lockfile handling especially with respect to unix sockets.
 - deferredGenerator now no longer overuses the stack, which sometimes
   caused stack overflows.
 - Failure.raiseException now at least always raises the correct Exception.
 - minor improvements to serialport code

Deprecations
------------
 - twisted.python.componts.getAdapter. Use IFoo(o) instead.
 - Adapter persistence (IFoo(x, persist=True)). Just don't use it.
 - log.debug. It was equivalent to log.msg(), just use that.
 - twisted.protocols.telnet. twisted.conch.telnet replaces it.
 - Setting a trial reporter using a flag to 'trial'. Instead of 'trial
   --bwverbose', for example, use 'trial --reporter=bwverbose'.
 - trial --coverage will become a flag in Twisted 2.2.
 - passing a fully-qualified python name to --reporter is
   deprecated. Pass only names of Reporter plugins.
 - trial --psyco.
 - trial -R (--recurse) is now the default, so passing it is deprecated.
 - trial --reporter-args. Use the plugin system to do this sort of thing.
 - trial.assertions.assertionMethod and trial.unittest.assertionMethod
   are both deprecated. Use instance methods on TestCases instead.
 - trial's deferredResult, deferredError, and wait functions. Return
   Deferreds from your test methods instead of using them.
 - Raising unittest.SkipTest with no arguments. Give a reason for your skip.
 - The Failure returned from a gatherResults and DeferredList is now
   of type FirstError instead of a tuple of (Exception, index). It
   supports a firstError[idx] syntax but that is deprecated. Use
   firstError.subFailure and firstError.index instead.
 - whenThreaded now simply calls the passed function synchronously.
