Twisted Names is both a domain name server as well as a client
resolver library. Twisted Names comes with an "out of the box"
nameserver which can read most BIND-syntax zone files as well as a
simple Python-based configuration format. Twisted Names can act as an
authoritative server, perform zone transfers from a master to act as a
secondary, act as a caching nameserver, or any combination of
these. Twisted Names' client resolver library provides functions to
query for all commonly used record types as well as a replacement for
the blocking gethostbyname() function provided by the Python stdlib
socket module.
