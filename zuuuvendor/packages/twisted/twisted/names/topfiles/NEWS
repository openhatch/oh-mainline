Twisted Names 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
=================================

Features
--------
 - twisted.names.server can now serve SPF resource records using
   twisted.names.dns.Record_SPF.  twisted.names.client can query for
   them using lookupSenderPolicy.   (#3928)

   (#4573)


Twisted Names 10.1.0 (2010-06-27)
=================================

   dictionary for looking up record types.  This yields a significant
   performance improvement on PyPy. (#4283)

 - client.Resolver now uses a full 16 bits of randomness for message IDs,
   instead of 10 which it previously used (#3342)

   (#2935)

Other
-----

==================

Fixes
-----

 - Refactor DNSDatagramProtocol and DNSProtocol to use same base class (#2414)
 - Change Resolver to query specified nameservers in specified order, instead
   of reverse order. (#2290)
 - Make SRVConnector work with bad results and NXDOMAIN responses.
   (#1908, #2777)

0.4.0 (2007-01-06)
