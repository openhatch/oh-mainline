Tests for L{twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks}.

These tests are defined in a non-C{test_*} module because they are
syntactically invalid on python < 2.5.  test_inlinecb will conditionally import
these tests on python 2.5 and greater.

Some tests for inlineCallbacks are defined in L{twisted.test.test_defgen} as
well: see U{http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4182}.
