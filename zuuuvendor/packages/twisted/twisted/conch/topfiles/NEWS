Twisted Conch 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
=================================

Bugfixes
--------
 - The transport for subsystem protocols now declares that it
   implements ITransport and implements the getHost and getPeer
   methods. (#2453)
 - twisted.conch.ssh.transport.SSHTransportBase now responds to key
   exchange messages at any time during a connection (instead of only
   at connection setup).  It also queues non-key exchange messages
   sent during key exchange to avoid corrupting the connection state.
   (#4395)
 - Importing twisted.conch.ssh.common no longer breaks pow(base, exp[,
   modulus]) when the gmpy package is installed and base is not an
   integer. (#4803)
 - twisted.conch.ls.lsLine now returns a time string which does not
   consider the locale. (#4937)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - Changed the man page for ckeygen to accurately reflect what it
   does, and corrected its synposis so that a second "ckeygen" is not
   a required part of the ckeygen command line.  (#4738)

Other
-----
 - #2112


Twisted Conch 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
=================================

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.conch.ssh.factory.SSHFactory no longer disables coredumps.
   (#2715)
 - The Deferred returned by twisted.conch.telnet.TelnetTransport.will
   now fires with an OptionRefused failure if the peer responds with a
   refusal for the option negotiation. (#4231)
 - SSHServerTransport and SSHClientTransport in
   twisted.conch.ssh.transport no longer use PyCrypto to generate
   random numbers for DH KEX.  They also now generate values from the
   full valid range, rather than only half of it. (#4469)
 - twisted.conch.ssh.connection.SSHConnection now errbacks leftover
   request deferreds on connection shutdown. (#4483)

Other
-----
 - #4677


Twisted Conch 10.1.0 (2010-06-27)
=================================

Features
--------
 - twisted.conch.ssh.transport.SSHTransportBase now allows supported
   ssh protocol versions to be overriden. (#4428)

Bugfixes
--------
 - SSHSessionProcessProtocol now doesn't close the session when stdin
   is closed, but instead when both stdout and stderr are. (#4350)
 - The 'cftp' command-line tool will no longer encounter an
   intermittent error, crashing at startup with a ZeroDivisionError
   while trying to report progress. (#4463)
 - twisted.conch.ssh.connection.SSHConnection now replies to requests
   to open an unknown channel with a OPEN_UNKNOWN_CHANNEL_TYPE message
   instead of closing the connection. (#4490)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.conch.insults.client was deprecated. (#4095)
 - twisted.conch.insults.colors has been deprecated.  Please use
   twisted.conch.insults.helper instead. (#4096)

   Twisted 9.0. (#4097)
 - Removed twisted.conch.ssh.common.Entropy, as Entropy.get_bytes has
   been  deprecated since 2007 and Entropy.get_bytes was the only
   attribute of Entropy. (#4098)
 - Removed twisted.conch.ssh.keys.getPublicKeyString, which has been
   deprecated since 2007.  Also updated the conch examples
   sshsimpleserver.py and sshsimpleclient.py to reflect this removal.
   (#4099)
 - Removed twisted.conch.ssh.keys.makePublicKeyString, which has been
   deprecated since 2007. (#4100)
 - Removed twisted.conch.ssh.keys.getPublicKeyObject, which has been
   deprecated since 2007. (#4101)

   deprecated since 2007.  Also updated the conch examples to reflect
   this removal. (#4102)
 - Removed twisted.conch.ssh.keys.makePrivateKeyString, which has been
   deprecated since 2007. (#4103)
 - Removed twisted.conch.ssh.keys.makePublicKeyBlob, which has been
   deprecated since 2007. (#4104)
 - Removed twisted.conch.ssh.keys.signData,

Twisted Conch 9.0.0 (2009-11-24)
================================

Fixes
-----
 - The SSH key parser has been removed and conch now uses pyASN1 to parse keys.
   This should fix a number of cases where parsing a key would fail, but it now
   requires users to have pyASN1 installed (#3391)
 - The time field on SFTP file listings should now be correct (#3503)
 - The day field on SFTP file listings should now be correct on Windows (#3503)
 - The "cftp" sftp client now truncates files it is uploading over (#2519)
 - The telnet server protocol can now properly respond to subnegotiation
   requests (#3655)
 - Tests and factoring of the SSHv2 server implementation are now much better
   (#2682)
 - The SSHv2 server now sends "exit-signal" messages to the client, instead of
   raising an exception, when a process dies due to a signal (#2687)
 - cftp's client-side "exec" command now uses /bin/sh if the current user has
   no shell (#3914)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - The buggy SSH connection sharing feature of the SSHv2 client was removed
   (#3498)
 - Use of strings and PyCrypto objects to represent keys is deprecated in favor
   of using Conch Key objects (#2682)
