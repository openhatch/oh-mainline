For information on what's new in Twisted 11.0.0, see the NEWS file that comes
with the distribution.

What is this?
=============

  Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications.  It includes
  modules for many different purposes, including the following:

  - twisted.application
    A "Service" system that allows you to organize your application in
    hierarchies with well-defined startup and dependency semantics,
  - twisted.cred
    A general credentials and authentication system that facilitates
    pluggable authentication backends,
  - twisted.enterprise
    Asynchronous database access, compatible with any Python DBAPI2.0
    modules,
  - twisted.internet
    Low-level asynchronous networking APIs that allow you to define
    your own protocols that run over certain transports,
  - twisted.manhole
    A tool for remote debugging of your services which gives you a
    Python interactive interpreter,
  - twisted.protocols
    Basic protocol implementations and helpers for your own protocol
    implementations,
  - twisted.python
    A large set of utilities for Python tricks, reflection, text
    processing, and anything else,
  - twisted.spread
    A secure, fast remote object system,
  - twisted.trial
    A unit testing framework that integrates well with Twisted-based code.

  Twisted supports integration of the Win32, Tk, GTK+ and GTK+ 2 event loops
  with its main event loop.  There is experimental support for Mac OS X and
  wxPython event loop integration, which you use at your peril.

  There are many official Twisted subprojects, including clients and
  servers for web, mail, DNS, and more. You can find out more about
  these projects at http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedProjects


Installing
==========

  Instructions for installing this software are in INSTALL.

Unit Tests
==========


  See our unit tests run proving that the software is BugFree(TM):

   % trial twisted

  Some of these tests may fail if you
   * don't have the dependancies required for a particular subsystem installed,
   * have a firewall blocking some ports (or things like Multicast, which Linux
     NAT has shown itself to do), or
   * run them as root.


Documentation and Support
=========================

  Examples on how to use Twisted APIs are located in doc/core/examples; this
  might ease the learning curve a little bit, since all these files are kept
  as short as possible.  The file doc/core/howto/index.xhtml contains an index
  of all the core HOWTOs: this should be your starting point when looking for
  documentation.

  Help is available on the Twisted mailing list:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python

  There is also a very lively IRC channel, #twisted, on
  chat.freenode.net.
