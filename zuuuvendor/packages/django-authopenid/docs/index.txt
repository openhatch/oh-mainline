Welcome to django-authopenid's documentation!
=============================================

.. rubric:: Everything you need to know about django-authopenid

**django-authopenid** is a Django_ application that allow you to authenticate your users while using the django auth contrib.

This application allow a user to connect to you website with :

 * legacy account : username/password
 * openid url

Idee is having workflow to integrate openid and _legacy_ authentification.

If the user connect with an openid he could associate it with its legaccy account or just create a new django account. When the user is connected you could manage him like you usually do with `auth contrib <http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/authentication/>`_ or `django-registration <http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/>`_ which is the default.
