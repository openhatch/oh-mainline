============================
Quick notes for contributors
============================

Distribute is using Mercurial.

Grab the code at bitbucket::

    $ hg clone https://tarek@bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute distribute

If you want to work in the 0.6 branch, you have to switch to it::

    $ hg update 0.6-maintenance

    $ hg branch
    0.6-maintenance

If you make some changes, don't forget to:

- backport it to the 0.7 branch
- add a note in CHANGES.txt

And remember that 0.6 is only bug fixes, and the APIs should
be fully backward compatible with Setuptools.

You can run the tests via::

    $ python setup.py test
