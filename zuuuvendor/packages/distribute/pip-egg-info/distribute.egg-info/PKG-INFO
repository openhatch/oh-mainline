        Installing and Using Distribute

        About the fork
        ==============
        
        `Distribute` is a fork of the `Setuptools` project.
        
        Distribute is intended to replace Setuptools as the standard method
        for working with Python module distributions.
        
        The fork has two goals:
        
        - Providing a backward compatible version to replace Setuptools
          and make all distributions that depend on Setuptools work as
          before, but with less bugs and behaviorial issues.
        
          This work is done in the 0.6.x series.
        
          Starting with version 0.6.2, Distribute supports Python 3.
          Installing and using distribute for Python 3 code works exactly
          the same as for Python 2 code, but Distribute also helps you to support
          Python 2 and Python 3 from the same source code by letting you run 2to3
          on the code as a part of the build process, by setting the keyword parameter
          ``use_2to3`` to True. See http://packages.python.org/distribute for more
          information.
        
        - Refactoring the code, and releasing it in several distributions.
          This work is being done in the 0.7.x series but not yet released.
        
        The roadmap is still evolving, and the page that is up-to-date is
        located at : `http://packages.python.org/distribute/roadmap`.
        
        If you install `Distribute` and want to switch back for any reason to
        `Setuptools`, get to the `Uninstallation instructions`_ section.
        
        More documentation
        ==================
        
        You can get more information in the Sphinx-based documentation, located
        at http://packages.python.org/distribute. This documentation includes the old
        Setuptools documentation that is slowly replaced, and brand new content.
        
        About the installation process
        ==============================
        
        The `Distribute` installer modifies your installation by de-activating an
        existing installation of `Setuptools` in a bootstrap process. This process
        has been tested in various installation schemes and contexts but in case of a
        bug during this process your Python installation might be left in a broken
        state. Since all modified files and directories are copied before the
        installation starts, you will be able to get back to a normal state by reading
        the instructions in the `Uninstallation instructions`_ section.
        
        In any case, it is recommended to save you `site-packages` directory before
        you start the installation of `Distribute`.
        
        -------------------------
        Installation Instructions
        -------------------------
        
        Distribute is only released as a source distribution.
        
        It can be installed using pip, and can be done so with the source tarball,
        or by using the ``distribute_setup.py`` script provided online.
        
        ``distribute_setup.py`` is the simplest and preferred way on all systems.
        
        distribute_setup.py
        ===================
        
        Download
        `distribute_setup.py <http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py>`_
        and execute it, using the Python interpreter of your choice.
        
        If your shell has the ``curl`` program you can do::
        
            $ curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
            $ python distribute_setup.py
        
        Notice this file is also provided in the source release.
        
        pip
        ===
        
        Run easy_install or pip::
        
            $ pip install distribute
        
        Source installation
        ===================
        
        Download the source tarball, uncompress it, then run the install command::
        
            $ curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.24.tar.gz
            $ tar -xzvf distribute-0.6.24.tar.gz
            $ cd distribute-0.6.24
            $ python setup.py install
        
        ---------------------------
        Uninstallation Instructions
        ---------------------------
        
        Like other distutils-based distributions, Distribute doesn't provide an
        uninstaller yet. It's all done manually! We are all waiting for PEP 376
        support in Python.
        
        Distribute is installed in three steps:
        
        1. it gets out of the way an existing installation of Setuptools
        2. it installs a `fake` setuptools installation
        3. it installs distribute
        
        Distribute can be removed like this:
        
        - remove the ``distribute*.egg`` file located in your site-packages directory
        - remove the ``setuptools.pth`` file located in you site-packages directory
        - remove the easy_install script located in you ``sys.prefix/bin`` directory
        - remove the ``setuptools*.egg`` directory located in your site-packages directory,
          if any.
        
        If you want to get back to setuptools:
        
        - reinstall setuptools using its instruction.
        
        Lastly:
        
        - remove the *.OLD.* directory located in your site-packages directory if any,
          **once you have checked everything was working correctly again**.
        
        -------------------------
        Quick help for developers
        -------------------------
        
        To create an egg which is compatible with Distribute, use the same
        practice as with Setuptools, e.g.::
        
            from setuptools import setup
        
            setup(...
            )
        
        To use `pkg_resources` to access data files in the egg, you should
        require the Setuptools distribution explicitly::
        
            from setuptools import setup
        
            setup(...
                install_requires=['setuptools']
            )
        
        Only if you need Distribute-specific functionality should you depend
        on it explicitly. In this case, replace the Setuptools dependency::
        
            from setuptools import setup
        
            setup(...
                install_requires=['distribute']
            )
        
        -----------
        Install FAQ
        -----------
        
        - **Why is Distribute wrapping my Setuptools installation?**
        
           Since Distribute is a fork, and since it provides the same package
           and modules, it renames the existing Setuptools egg and inserts a
           new one which merely wraps the Distribute code. This way, full
           backwards compatibility is kept for packages which rely on the
           Setuptools modules.
        
           At the same time, packages can meet their dependency on Setuptools
           without actually installing it (which would disable Distribute).
        
        - **How does Distribute interact with virtualenv?**
        
          Everytime you create a virtualenv it will install setuptools by default.
          You either need to re-install Distribute in it right after or pass the
          ``--distribute`` option when creating it.
        
          Once installed, your virtualenv will use Distribute transparently.
        
          Although, if you have Setuptools installed in your system-wide Python,
          and if the virtualenv you are in was generated without the `--no-site-packages`
          option, the Distribute installation will stop.
        
          You need in this case to build a virtualenv with the `--no-site-packages`
          option or to install `Distribute` globally.
        
        - **How does Distribute interacts with zc.buildout?**
        
          You can use Distribute in your zc.buildout, with the --distribute option,
          starting at zc.buildout 1.4.2::
        
          $ python bootstrap.py --distribute
        
          For previous zc.buildout versions, *the only thing* you need to do
          is use the bootstrap at `http://python-distribute.org/bootstrap.py`.  Run
          that bootstrap and ``bin/buildout`` (and all other buildout-generated
          scripts) will transparently use distribute instead of setuptools.  You do
          not need a specific buildout release.
        
          A shared eggs directory is no problem (since 0.6.6): the setuptools egg is
          left in place unmodified.  So other buildouts that do not yet use the new
          bootstrap continue to work just fine.  And there is no need to list
          ``distribute`` somewhere in your eggs: using the bootstrap is enough.
        
          The source code for the bootstrap script is located at
          `http://bitbucket.org/tarek/buildout-distribute`.

        * Issue 70: exec bit on non-exec files
        * Issue 99: now the standalone easy_install command doesn't uses a
          "setup.cfg" if any exists in the working directory. It will use it
          only if triggered by ``install_requires`` from a setup.py call

          with a nicer message for the end user.
        * Issue 100: making sure there's no SandboxViolation when
          the setup script patches setuptools.
        
        -----
        0.6.8
        -----

        * Fixed the DONT_PATCH_SETUPTOOLS state.
        
        -----
        0.6.7
        -----
        
        * Issue 58: Added --user support to the develop command
        * Issue 11: Generated scripts now wrap their call to the script entry point
          in the standard "if name == 'main'"
        * Added the 'DONT_PATCH_SETUPTOOLS' environment variable, so virtualenv
          can drive an installation that doesn't patch a global setuptools.
        * Reviewed unladen-swallow specific change from
          http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/source/detail?spec=svn875&r=719
          and determined that it no longer applies. Distribute should work fine with
          Unladen Swallow 2009Q3.
        * Issue 21: Allow PackageIndex.open_url to gracefully handle all cases of a
          httplib.HTTPException instead of just InvalidURL and BadStatusLine.
        * Removed virtual-python.py from this distribution and updated documentation
          to point to the actively maintained virtualenv instead.
        * Issue 64: use_setuptools no longer rebuilds the distribute egg every
          time it is run
        * use_setuptools now properly respects the requested version
        * use_setuptools will no longer try to import a distribute egg for the
          wrong Python version
        * Issue 74: no_fake should be True by default.
        * Issue 72: avoid a bootstrapping issue with easy_install -U

        -----
        0.6.5
        -----
        
        * Issue 65: cli.exe and gui.exe are now generated at build time,
          depending on the platform in use.
        
        * Issue 67: Fixed doc typo (PEP 381/382)
        
        * Distribute no longer shadows setuptools if we require a 0.7-series
          setuptools.  And an error is raised when installing a 0.7 setuptools with
          distribute.
        
        * When run from within buildout, no attempt is made to modify an existing
          setuptools egg, whether in a shared egg directory or a system setuptools.
        
        * Fixed a hole in sandboxing allowing builtin file to write outside of
          the sandbox.
