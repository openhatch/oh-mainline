Versioning test text
====================

So the thing is I need some kind of text - not the lorem ipsum stuff, that
doesn't work out that well - to test :mod:`sphinx.versioning`. I couldn't find
a good text for that under public domain so I thought the easiest solution is
to write one by myself. It's not really interesting, in fact it is *really*
boring.

Anyway I need more than one paragraph, at least three for the original
document, I think, and another one for two different ones.

So the previous paragraph was a bit short because I don't want to test this
only on long paragraphs, I hope it was short enough to cover most stuff.
Anyway I see this lacks ``some markup`` so I have to add a **little** bit.

Woho another paragraph, if this test fails we really have a problem because
this means the algorithm itself fails and not the diffing algorithm which is
pretty much doomed anyway as it probably fails for some kind of language
respecting certain nodes anyway but we can't work around that anyway.
