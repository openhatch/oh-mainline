Some Tests for the LaTeX Writer
===============================

These tests have been written to exercise some unusual combinations of
syntax elements which may cause trouble for the LaTeX writer but do
not need to be tested with other writers (e.g. the HTML writer).

This file is not yet used by any automated test.  It is currently only
used to control the visual appearance of the output.

Rowspanning tables
------------------

Several rowspanning cells in a table.

.. Problem:

   In the LaTeX `multicol` package, if there are multirow cells, the
   "overwritten" cells need to be defined as empty cells.

   Docutils (similarily to HTML) uses is the "Exchange Table Model" (also
   known as CALS tables, see docs/ref/soextblx.dtd) which defines only the
   remaining cells in a row "affected" by multirow cells.

   Therefore, visit_entry() is only called for the remaining cells and the
   LaTeX writer needs bookkeeping to write out the required number of extra
   '&'s.
