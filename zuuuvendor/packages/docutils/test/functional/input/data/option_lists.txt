Option lists
------------

The LaTeX-2e description environment is used for definition lists. 
The definition is continued on the same line as the term, this should
not happen if a option-list is at the top of the definition.

If the option list is not at the first element in the definition, it
is contained in a quote

  --help  show help
  -v      verbose

In a definition list:
  --help  show help
  -v      verbose
