External references
-------------------

Long URLs should be wrapped in the PDF.
This can be achieved with the \url command which is used by the LaTeX writer
whenever the content (name) of a reference node equals the link URL.

Example:
  a long URL that should wrap in the output
  http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/latex.html#id79


If the argument contains any "%", "#", or "^^", or ends with ``\``, it can't
be used in the argument to another command. The argument must not contain
unbalanced braces.

The characters ^, {, }, and ``\`` are invalid in a "http:" or "ftp:" URL
and not recognized as part of it:
  
| http://www.example.org/strange^^name
| http://www.example.org\\using\\DOS\\paths\\
| http://www.example.org/XML/strange{n}ame

They can, however be used in paths and/or filenames.

Handling by the LaTeX writer:

* ``#``, ``\`` and ``%`` are escaped:

  | `URL with # <http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema#dev>`__
    http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema#dev
  | `URL with % <http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema%dev>`__
    http://example.org/Schema%dev
  | `file with DOS path`__ `A:DOS\\path\\`__
  
  .. note:: These URLs are typeset inside a LaTeX command without error.
  
    | http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema#dev
    | http://example.org/Schema%dev
    | `A:DOS\\path\\`__

__  
__  
__ A:DOS\\path\\


* ^^ LaTeX's special syntax for characters results in "strange" replacements
  (both with \href and \url). A warning is given.

  `file with ^^ <../strange^^name>`__:
  `<../strange^^name>`__

* Unbalanced braces, { or }, will fail (both with \href and \url)::

    `file with { <../strange{name>`__
    `<../strange{name>`__

  while balanced braces are suported:
  
  | `<../strange{n}ame>`__
  | `<../st{r}ange{n}ame>`__
  | `<../{st{r}ange{n}ame}>`__
