SWF Images
----------

Shockwave Flash is an image/movie format that most modern web browsers
support via a plugin. It is sometimes blocked due to privacy/security
concerns.

Images with extension ``.swf`` are placed inside <object> elements.
For complete control over display options use raw HTML.

   :align: left

   :width:  0.8 em
   :height: 0.8 em
