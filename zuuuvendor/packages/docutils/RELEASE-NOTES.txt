Future changes
==============

* remove the `handle_io_errors` option from io.FileInput/Output.

* »Prune« the doctree (no change to the reST input syntax):

  - "doctest" element -> literal block with class argument,
  - special admonitions (note, hint, warning, ...) -> generic "admonition"
    element with class attribute and auto-generated title.


Release 0.11 (2013-07-22)
=========================

* General

  - Apply [ 2714873 ] Fix for the overwritting of document attributes.
  - Support embedded aliases within hyperlink references.
  - Fix [ 228 ] try local import of docutils components (reader, writer, parser,
    language module) before global search.

* docutils/parsers/rst/directives/tables.py

  - Fix [ 210 ] Python 3.3 checks CVS syntax only if "strict" is True.

* docutils/writers/html4css1/__init__.py
  - Fix [ 3600051 ] for tables in a list, table cells are not compacted.
  - New setting `stylesheet_dirs` (see above).

    Now, it is easy to add a custom stylesheet to Docutils' default
    stylesheet with, e.g., ``--stylesheet_path='html4css1.css, mystyle.css'``

    Changed behaviour of the default settings:
      if there is a file ``html4css1.css`` in the working directory of the
      process at launch, it is used instead of the one provided by Docutils
      in the writer source directory.

  - New default for math-output_: ``HTML math.css``.
  - Avoid repeated class declarations in html4css1 writer
    (modified version of patch [ 104 ]).

.. _math-output: docs/user/config.html#math-output

* docutils/writers/latex2e/__init__.py

  - Drop the simple algorithm replacing straight double quotes with
    English typographic ones.
    Activate the SmartQuotes_ transform if you want this feature.
  - New setting `stylesheet_dirs`: Comma-separated list of directories
    where stylesheets are found. Used by `stylesheet_path` when expanding
    relative path arguments.

.. _SmartQuotes: docs/user/config.html#smart-quotes

* docutils/writers/manpage.py

  - Fix [3607063] handle lines starting with a period.
  - Fix option separating comma was bold (thanks to Bill Morris).

Release 0.10 (2012-12-16)

.. Note::

   Docutils 0.9.x is the last version supporting Python 2.3.

   Docutils 0.10 is compatible with Python versions from 2.4 to 3.2
   (cf. `Python 3 compatibility`_).

* General:

  - SmartQuotes transform for typographic quotes and dashes.

  - ``docutils/math``, ``docutils/error_reporting.py``, and
    ``docutils/urischemes.py`` moved to the utils package.
    Code importing these modules needs to adapt, e.g.::

      try:
          import docutils.math as math
      except ImportError:
          import docutils.utils.math as math

  - enhanced math and error handling.

* docutils/io.py

  - FileInput/FileOutput: no system-exit on IOError.
    The `handle_io_errors` option is ignored.

.. _Python 3 compatibility: README.html#python-3-compatibility

* docutils/writers/html4css1/__init__.py

  - Use ``<code>`` tag for inline "code",
    do not drop nested inline nodes (syntax highlight tokens).

    stored in ``docutils/test3/``, tools no longer need conversion.

    If you installed one of Docutils versions 0.7 ... 0.9 with
    ``setup.py install`` under Python 3, remove the spurious
    ``test/`` and ``tools/`` directories in the site library root.


Release 0.9 (2012-05-02)

      .. _figure name:

      .. figure:: image.png

    has more than one paragraph (Wolfgang Scherer).

__ docs/user/latex.html#output-encoding

General:

* io.FileInput opens files as text files with universal newline support
  (mode "rU", configurable with the new optional argument "mode").

  - Python 3 support: copy test/ and tools/ to the build-dir
    and convert Python sources with 2to3.


Release 0.6 (2009-10-11)
========================

.. Note::

   Docutils 0.5 is the last version supporting Python 2.2.

   Docutils 0.6 is compatible with Python versions from 2.3 up to 2.6
   and convertible to 3.1 code.

.. note::

   The "newlatex" writer is orphaned.

   The recommended way to generate PDF output is to use either the
   LaTeX2e writer or one of the alternatives listed at
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/links.html#pdf.

* reStructuredText:

  - Allow length units for all length specifications.
  - Allow percent sign in "scale" argument of "figure" and "image" directives.
  - Bugfix: The "figalign" argument of a figure now works as intended
    (aligning the figure not its contents).
  - Align images with class "align-[right|center|left]"
    (allows setting the alignment of an image in a figure).
  - Hard tabs in literal inclusions are replaced by spaces. This is
    configurable via the new "tab-width" option of the "include" directive
    (a negative tab-width prevents tab expansion).

* HTML writer:

  - ``--stylesheet`` and ``--stylesheet-path`` options now support a comma
    separated list of stylesheets.

* LaTeX2e writer:

  - New defaults:
    - font-encoding: "T1" (formerly implicitely set by 'ae').

    - use-latex-footnotes: true (no mixup with figures).
    - Float placement defaults to "here definitely" (configurable).
    - Align of image in a figure defaults to 'center'.
    - Use class defaults for page margins ('typearea' now optional).
  - Support LaTeX packages as ``--stylesheet`` arguments.

    do not convert ``px`` to ``pt``.
  - Do not use 'ae' and 'aeguill' packages if font-encoding is set to ''.
  - Set sub- and superscript role argument as text not math.
  - Support custom roles based on standard roles.
  - Load packages and define macros only if required in the document.
  - All Docutils specific LaTeX macros are prefixed with ``DU``.
  - Better conformance to Docutils specifications with "use_latex_toc".
  - If 'sectnum_xform' is False, the 'sectnum' directive triggers
    section numbering by LaTeX.
  - Use default font in admonitions and sidebar.
  - Typeset generic topic as "quote with title".
  - Use template (file and configuration option).
  - Render doctest blocks as literal blocks (indented).
