There are a whole bunch of files here. Here's what you need to know:

Important files in git
----------------------

mysite/
    This directory contains the OpenHatch website and all the "apps" that
    are part of it. Each subdirectory is an app.

    customs/
        This directory contains "import/export" code like the support for
        loading and saving snapshots of the OpenHatch database, downloading
        data from bug trackers, and scanning other websites for information about
        OpenHatch members.

    profile/
        This app contains code to show information about the users of OpenHatch.

    account/
        This app (mostly) contains code to let users edit their own information.

    missions/
        This is the Django app where the training missions live.

    senseknocker/
        This was a Django app we were going to write that took feedback from users.

    search/
        This Django app contains the views and models necessary to display the volunteer
        opportunity finder, also known as bug search.

    */tests.py
    */views.py
    */forms.py
    */models.py
        Each of the apps has some tests, views, and frequently models and forms.


buildout.cfg
setup.py
    These files, together, list the dependencies of the OpenHatch codebase.

Important files that are auto-generated
---------------------------------------

downloads/
eggs/
parts/
    Dependencies that get auto-downloaded get placed here. Every time you run
    buildout, the contents of these directories could change.

bin/
    These are scripts that are generated by buildout. Useful ones:

    mysite
    sqlite_mysite

        These are wrappers around the familiar Django "manage.py" that set up
        the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable.

        If you're looking for "python manage.py", run ./bin/mysite instead.

        (sqlite_mysite is a version of the above that uses an in-memory SQLite database
        instead of the MySQL database. You can use that to run the test suite faster.)

Unimportant files
-----------------

apt_pkg/
    This is pseudo-Python package that makes it so "import apt_pkg" works.

    One of our dependencies requires that, so we provide a fake one.
