There are a whole bunch of files here. Here's what you need to know:

Important files in git
----------------------

README.rst
    Read the README! Read it first.

    (Aside: it has a ".rst" extension because it is in reStructuredText format.)

COPYING
    This file explains what permissions you have, if you want to re-use
    source code you find in this repository.

vendor/
    This directory contains code from other projects that we rely on.

mysite/
    This directory contains the OpenHatch website and all the "apps" that
    are part of it. Each subdirectory is an app.

    customs/
        This directory contains "import/export" code like the support for
        loading and saving snapshots of the OpenHatch database, downloading
        data from bug trackers, and scanning other websites for information about
        OpenHatch members.

    profile/
        This app contains code to show information about the users of OpenHatch.

    account/
        This app (mostly) contains code to let users edit their own information.

    missions/
        This is the Django app where the training missions live.

    search/
        This Django app contains the views and models necessary to display the volunteer
        opportunity finder, also known as bug search.

    */tests.py
    */views.py
    */forms.py
    */models.py
        Each of the apps has some tests, views, and frequently models and forms.


manage.py
    This is the well-known and widely-loved Django management script. (In the past, we used
    to wrap it with ./bin/mysite or ./bin/production. No longer!)

setup.py
    This file lists the dependencies of the OpenHatch codebase.
