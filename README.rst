The Future of OpenHatch
-----------------------

The OpenHatch code base will be in transition over the course of 2016. Here are some 2016 resolutions from the OpenHatch core team:

* OpenHatch will focus on encouraging users and organizations to run Open
  Source Comes to Campus events. (This probably makes the best use of our
  volunteer energy.)

* A new landing page for openhatch.org will be created and simplify access
  to useful resources. (It will probably be static HTML.)

* The existing Django website will be archived as a time capsule of
  OpenHatch's past.

* We will migrate the training missions to some kind of technology set that
  doesn't require us to maintain a backend. (Perhaps
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/workshopper )

* We will investigate migrating the wiki to another host, decoupling it
  from OpenHatch logins. (This will probably mean you'll have to do password
  resets to regain access to your account. Working out the details.)

* We will try to find another community to house the volunteer opportunity
  finder, perhaps the nice people behind http://up-for-grabs.net/. (It'd be
  nice if we can fix the constantly-broken bug importers, resulting in us
  contributing something novel to up-for-grabs.net, namely the ability to
  search non-github projects. Probably this would result in us running the
  bug importers on the Heroku infrastructure, thanks to John's work.)

* While we make these changes, we will continue to strive to be a welcoming
  and friendly community. That will mean, for example, helping people get
  their current pull requests merged if they're interested in the educational
  value of doing that.

* We will have a regularly scheduled monthly development meeting that is
  open to all to participate.
