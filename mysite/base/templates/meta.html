<h2>Diagnostics for bug tracker updating</h2>

<h3>What are we diagnosing?</h3>

<p>So we store these "Bug" objects. How do they update?</p>

<p>Each Bug object doesn't know how to update itself. Instead, we have
a nightly job per bug tracker. When that job wakes up,
it refreshes all the bugs that came from that bug tracker.
</p>

<p>So if a Bug object's last_polled stamp is more old than one day + one hour,
then it means we're not properly updating it from its bug tracker. If it's older
than <em>two</em> days, then something is terribly wrong!</p>

<p>These Bug diagnostics only apply to bugs we think are <em>open</em>.
We happen to retain information on bugs that were once open (for example,
if the bug was marked as resolved), but it is not important if those bugs
become stale.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<table>
{% for key, value in bug_diagnostics.items %}
<tr>
<td>{{ key }}:</td>
<td>{{ value }}</td>
</tr>
{% endfor %}
