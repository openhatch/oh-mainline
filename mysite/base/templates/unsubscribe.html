<p> Oops, this particular unsubscribe link doesn't work. Try emailing us at <a href='mailto:hello@openhatch.org'>hello@openhatch.org</a>. </p>

Why are you seeing this page?, you ask. Well, we couldn't find anyone corresponding to the token <code> {{ token_string }}</code>. Possible explanations: the token string is too old (they expire after a few months); we screwed up somewhere; you were fooling with the URL, bravo.
