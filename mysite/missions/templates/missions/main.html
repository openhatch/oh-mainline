    <h2>About the training missions</h2>
    <p>Some video games have a “training level” where you can get shot
      at without dying. These training missions are a place to learn
      open source contribution skills without getting burned.</p>

    <p>A training mission shuns “manuals” and long, boring blobs
    of text. Instead it says, “Here’s a short, concrete task to
    perform. Interact with this web-based robot here, and it will tell
    you if you succeeded.”</p>

    <h2>Before the missions: Prepare your command line</h2>

    <p>Contributing to free, open source software frequently
      requires using a text-based command line. Our training
      missions are written with that in mind. A command line
      is available on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and other systems,
      and we can show you how to launch it and play around in it.</p>

    <p>If you're not sure how to use a command prompt to run programs
      like tar, diff, and git, on Windows you can get started with
      "Prepare your command line" below. We have not written our own
      instructions for other platforms yet, but you can try these
      external resources for <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal">Ubuntu</a>
      and <a href="http://mac.tutsplus.com/tutorials/terminal/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction/">Mac OS</a>.</p>

    <h2>Where they came from, and where they're going</h2>
    <p>You can read about
      <a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2010/the-thinking-behind-the-training-missions/">vision behind the training missions</a> on the OpenHatch blog.
      They were initially built as a
      <a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2010/google-summer-of-code-project-training-missions/">Google Summer of Code</a> project.
    </p>

    <p>Now, our community of volunteers takes care of creating more missions and fixing bugs in them. We could use feedback, and if you want to jump in to help, we'd love to have you!
      <a href="http://openhatch.org/contact/">Get in touch with us</a> and let us know what you think (or how you want to help out!). If you get stuck, <a href="http://openhatch.org/wiki/Mission_help">read our tips</a>.
