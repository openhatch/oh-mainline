    <h2>About the training missions</h2>
    <p>Some video games have a “training level” where you can get shot
      at without dying. These training missions are a place to learn
      open source contribution skills without getting burned.</p>

    <p>A training mission shuns “manuals” and long, boring blobs
    of text. Instead it says, “Here’s a short, concrete task to
    perform. Interact with this web-based robot here, and it will tell
    you if you succeeded.”</p>

    <h2>Get to know about: "The Shell"</h2>

    <p>These missions teach you about how to use the command line tool called the "shell" and few basic commands which will help you in other missions.
    </p>

    <div class="submodule-container">
    {% with fully_completed_missions.shell as mission_completed %}
    {% with "Using the shell" as mission_title %}
    {% with "Learn how to use the shell and play with commands." as mission_description %}
    {% with "/missions/shell/about" as mission_link %}

    <h2>Before the missions: Prepare your command line</h2>

    <p>Contributing to free, open source software frequently
      requires using a text-based command line. Our training
      missions are written with that in mind. A command line
      is available on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and other systems,
      and we can show you how to launch it and play around in it.</p>

    <p>If you're not sure how to use a command prompt to run programs
      like tar, diff, and git on Windows, you can get started with
      "Prepare your command line" below. We have not written our own
      instructions for other platforms yet, but you can try these
      external resources for <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal">Ubuntu</a>
      and <a href="http://mac.tutsplus.com/tutorials/terminal/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction/">Mac OS</a>.</p>

    <h2>Get to know the tech used within open source</h2>

    <p>These missions give you a tour of command-line tools you may
      run into when contributing to free software.</p>

    <div class="submodule-container">
    {% with fully_completed_missions.tar as mission_completed %}

    <h2>Setup your Python environment</h2>

    <p>These missions teach you how to install Python packages and create
    virtual environments.</p>

    </p>

    <p>Now, our community of volunteers takes care of creating more missions and fixing bugs in them. We could use feedback, and if you want to jump in to help, we'd love to have you!
      <a href="http://openhatch.org/contact/">Get in touch with us</a> and let us know what you think (or how you want to help out!). If you get stuck, <a href="http://openhatch.org/wiki/Mission_help">read our tips</a>.
