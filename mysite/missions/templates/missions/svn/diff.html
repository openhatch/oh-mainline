<p>You can't do the diffing step yet. You have to do the

<p>It's good of you to share with us the information you have gathered, but you still have to gain a little more of Mr. Bad's trust.</p>
<p>Your headquarters knows that Mr. Bad isn't the best typist, so it is likely that the plans have a typographical error somewhere.  Mr. Bad is embarrassed by typos, so if you were to fix such an error, that would make him happy.  Maybe he will even be happy enough to grant you commit access.</p>

<p>You can give Mr. Bad a patch containing your changes.  If he likes it, he'll commit it for you.</p>

<p>Your mission is this:</p>
<ul class="raquo_bullets">
  <li>You can use your working copy from the previous mission.</li>
  <li>The file <code>{{ file_for_svn_diff }}</code> contains a spelling error.  Fix it in your working copy.</li>
  <li>Run <code>svn diff</code> and paste its output into the box below.</li>
</ul>
