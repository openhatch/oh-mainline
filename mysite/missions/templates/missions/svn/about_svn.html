<p>Most open source projects keep their code in a version control system (<abbr title="version control system">VCS</abbr>).  Subversion is a popular VCS for open source projects.  Subversion is a non-distributed VCS, meaning that there is a single central repository that all users and developers interact with.</p>

<p>A VCS tracks changes that are made to the code.  Each change has a timestamp, an author name, and a log message associated with it.  If two people modify the same file, the VCS catches this and merges both sets of changes; the second person is shown any conflicts that occur so the conflicts can be resolved.  One can also look through the history of the codebase.</p>

<p>This mission consists of three parts: checking out a working copy, creating a diff of changes to a working copy, and committing changes.</p>

<h3>Projects that use Subversion</h3>

<p>There are too many to list. Thousands. Hundreds of thousands?</p>

  <li>Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion">an article about it</a>. Subversion's history as a project is quite interesting.</li>
  <li>Many Subversion users chat using IRC in #svn on FreeNode.</li>
