    <p>Git Bash has a silly name. It's comprised of two parts:</p>

    <ul class="raquo_bullets">
      <li><tt>git</tt>: a version control tool we have a training mission about, and</li>
      <li><tt>bash</tt>: a shell that runs commands once you type the name of a command and press &lt;enter&gt; on your keyboard.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To install it, go to the
      <a href="http://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/releases/">msysgit featured downloads list</a>
      and find the most recent "Full installer." At the time of writing, it is called "Git-1.7.8-preview20111206.exe". Click on that link, and click again to download the file.</p>

    <p>Find the file on your computer, and run it. You'll see a series of questions; <strong>we recommend accepting the defaults</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you want to see what the screens will look like,
      <a target="_blank" href="http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/">see these screenshots</a>.</p>
