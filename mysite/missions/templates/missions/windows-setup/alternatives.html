    <p>(Warning: This page is exciting if you are interested in
      learning about our priorities and lots of other ways to get a
      command prompt on Windows. If you just want your computer to
      have a functioning command prompt, and learn how to use it well,
      read the other pages!)</p>

    <p>There are three major command prompt systems on Windows:</p>

    <ul class="raquo_bullets">
      <li>cmd.exe</li>
      <li>Cygwin</li>
      <li>mingw</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We recommend a UNIX-y prompt like Cygwin or mingw because the
    training missions teach how to use tools like tar and
    git. Installing those without Cygwin or the Git Bash installer can
    be error-prone and time-consuming.</p>

    <p>In choosing the Git Bash installer over Cygwin, we like that
    the following aspects:</p>

    <ul class="raquo_bullets">
      <li>The installer offers relatively few options, compared to Cygwin's long option list.</li>
      <li>The programs within mingw provide slightly better Windows integration.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you already have Cygwin installed, and are comfortable with
    it, you should be able to do the training missions within that
    environment. However, you will not be able to use our recommended
    instructions for installing software. Git Bash and Cygwin can
    co-exist peacefully.</p>

    <p>We're aware there are even more alternative options for running
    UNIX-y tools on Windows. mingw64 is a separate project from
    ming32, and mingw64 is more actively-maintained. (For example,
    Debian is standardizing its Windows compiler collection to be
    based on the mingw64 project's work.) You can run GNU/Linux and
    Windows at the same time through tools like coLinux and
    VirtualBox. Microsoft provides a toolkit called Services For
    Unix.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the choice of terminal emulator and shell are
      actually separate. Cygwin and mingw, by default, use the same
      C/SRSS system that powers cmd.exe. You can run Cygwin and an X
      server and xterm, for just one alternate configuration; it would
      look
      <a href="http://fuckyeahx11.tumblr.com/post/13559856792">something like this</a>.
      You could use
      PuTTY as the terminal emulator and the bash bundled with Git
      Bash. Our tutorial glosses over that difference, but power users
      might be intrigued by these options.</p>

    <p>For those with who warmly remember GNU-y prompts in Windows and
    DOS over the past twenty years, I suggest reading
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuWin32">the Wikipedia
    page for GnuWin32 </a> following links from there. I have fond
    memories of GnuWin32, and you may have enjoyed DJGPP.</p>

    <p>One important note is that the command prompt ("cmd.exe")
      common thought is that command prompts on Windows are called
      "DOS."  Since 2001, the accurate term is "command prompt." You
      can
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft_Windows">read more about the history of Windows and DOS on Wikipedia</a>.
