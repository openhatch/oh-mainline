    <p>When Git Bash opens, it starts "in" your user folder on your
    computer. The bash prompt shows you the current working directory,
    abbreviated slightly. You can see the full path by typing this and
    pressing enter:</p>

    <blockquote><tt>pwd</blockquote></tt>

    <p>Short, abbreviated command names are common in bash. This
    stands for "Print Working Directory." (Directory is another term
    for folder.)</p>

    <p>You can list the files and folders that are underneath the current working directory by typing:</p>

    <blockquote><tt>ls</tt></blockquote>

    <p>You'll find an entry labeled "Desktop" You can change into that directory with "cd":</p>

    <blockquote><tt>cd Desktop</tt></blockquote>

    <p>You should see that the prompt has changed to reflect that you
    are "in" the Desktop. Now when you ask for a directory
    listing:</p>

    <blockquote><tt>ls</tt></blockquote>

    <p>You'll see all the things on your computer's desktop. If your
    desktop is empty, try creating a file and saving it on the
    desktop. Once you've done that, if you run "ls" again, you will
    see your new file.</p>

    <p>You can change to the directory "above" the current working directory by using a special name, "..". Try typing these commands and pressing enter after each one:</p>

    <blockquote><tt>cd ..<br>
	ls</tt></blockquote>

    <p>You should see the same directory listing as you saw first!</p>

    <p>This concludes our tutorial. You might enjoy referring to the quick reference later on. For now, we suggest you go...</p>
