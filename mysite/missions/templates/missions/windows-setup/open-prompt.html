    <p>In this section, we will make sure you can open the Git Bash prompt that you just installed. To launch it:</p>

    <ul class="raquo_bullets">
      <li>Click the Windows or Start icon</li>
      <li>In the Programs list, open the Git folder</li>
      <li>Click the option for Git Bash.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>(Don't be distracted by the "Git GUI" program. In this tutorial, we use "Git Bash.")</p>

    <p>You should see a new window that looks like
