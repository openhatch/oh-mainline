    <p>Most development tools for contributing to free, open source
    software projects are built with simple text-based
    interfaces. This includes UNIX-like tools such as diff and tar,
    often provided by
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">the GNU project</a>.</p>

    <p>Many Windows users never learn about the command line, so these
    tools can seem arcane or intimidating. You can relax; the tools
    are often simple to use once you have them properly installed and
    can run them easily. We wrote this set of instructions so that you
    can get used to them and dive into the training missions as easily
    as possible.</p>

    <p>We chose what we think is the best source for these
      programs. You'll use Git Bash, a project that is under active
      maintenance and creates a prompt on Windows that is similar to a
      UNIX-like system. These tools run within Windows, and are easy
      to uninstall whenever you want to.  You will be able to refer to
      our quick reference for a refresher of what you learn in this
      tutorial. If you already think you might have these tools
      installed a different way, or want to learn about other ways to
      install them, read the "Alternatives" section on the left.</p>
