      <h3>Tools for working with tar archives</h3>
      <p>If you are running a GNU/Linux distribution, Mac OS X, or another Unix-like operating system, your system almost certainly has the tar program on it already, and you can run it by typing "tar" into a terminal.  If you are running Windows and prefer to try this the Unix way, you can get tar as part of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/BaseSystem/msys-1.0.11/MSYS-1.0.11.exe/download">MSYS</a>; many Windows archiving programs, such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a>, support working with tar archives as well.</p>
      <p>This page is just a quick reference; see the bottom for other resources.</p>
      <h3>Unpacking (and listing)</h3>
      <p>To unpack a tarball, you can use:</p>
      <pre>tar xvzf <em>[tarball]</em></pre>
      <p>To be more specific:</p>
      <pre>tar <em>[option letters]</em>xf <em>[tarball]</em></pre>
      <p>(The <tt>x</tt> stands for e<strong>x</strong>tract.)</p>
      <p>The tarball's contents are placed into the current directory.  Option letter <tt>z</tt> makes tar transparently un-gzip the tarball, and <tt>v</tt> shows the filenames as tar unpacks them.</p>

      <p>Listing a tarball works the same way as unpacking it, except that you use <tt>tf</tt> instead of <tt>xf</tt>.</p> 
      <p>So the command would look something like:</p>
      <pre>tar <em>[option letters]</em>tf <em>[tarball]</em></pre>
      <p>(The <tt>t</tt> stands for lis<strong>t</strong>.  Go figure.)</p>
      <p>Option letter <tt>v</tt>, which would otherwise be redundant because tar is already listing the contents as it examines the tarball, shows more details (such as permissions and sizes) about the files inside.</p>

      <p>It is generally a good idea to try unpacking or listing a tarball you are about to send out so you can verify that it really contains what you wanted.</p>

      <h3>Creating a tarball</h3>
      <p>If you have a directory named <em>dir</em>, and you want to make a tar file called <em>mytar.tar.gz</em>, you could:</p>
      <pre>tar zcvf <em>mytar.tar.gz</em> <em>dir</em></pre>
      <p>The general way to create a tarball from a set of files and directories is:</p>
      <pre>tar <em>[option letters]</em>cf <em>[tarball]</em> <em>[things to tar up]</em></pre>
      <p>(The <tt>c</tt> stands for <strong>c</strong>reate, and the <tt>f</tt> means that the next argument is the <strong>f</strong>ile you want tar to work with.)</p>
      <p>Common option letters are <tt>v</tt> (<strong>v</strong>erbose) to make tar list the things it is adding as it goes along and <tt>z</tt> to make tar g<strong>z</strong>ip the tarball for you rather than giving you an uncompressed one.</p>
      <p>If any of the things listed to include in the tarball is a directory, tar will automatically recursively add everything inside the directory too.  This is part of the reason for the convention of using a single wrapper directory, as then that is the only thing you have to explicitly list when creating the tarball.</p>
      <h3>Other resources</h3>
      <p>There are many more options to tar, which are detailed in tar's documentation.  The ones mentioned here, though, are the most commonly used ones. For further reading:</p>
      <ul class="raquo_bullets">
      <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28file_format%29">Wikipedia has some good information about the tar program and tarballs.</a></li>
      <li>Tar comes with a user "manual". You can read that by typing <tt>man tar</tt> in a terminal, or by <a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?tar">visiting this page</a>.</li>
