      <h3>Your mission</h3>
      <p>All but one part of this mission will occur by interacting with a bot over IRC.  When you join the mission channel, the bot will give you all of the rest of this mission's instructions.  Here's how to get up to that point:</p>
      <ul class="raquo_bullets">
      <li>Connect to {{ irc_netname }} (if it's not in your client's list, try server <code>{{ irc_server }}</code>, port <code>{{ irc_port }}</code>)</li>
      <li>Join the <code>{{ irc_channel }}</code> channel.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="next_mission_link">
      <a href='{% url "mysite.missions.irc.views.irc_secrets" %}'>Checking the secret password&raquo;</a></p>
