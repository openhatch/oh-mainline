<p>You can't do the diffing step yet. You have to do the
  <a href="{% url mysite.missions.git.views.checkout %}">checkout step first</a>!

<p>Now that you have a copy of the repository, you can fix the problem before it spreads further.</p>
<p>In most cases, especially when starting to contribute to an open source project, you will not have rights to commit directly to the code base. Your contributions will be sent to the project maintainers using a patch file.  This file contains the contents of your changes.  The maintainers can review your work and then merge the changes into the main project, when ready. Using these steps, you can give The Brain a patch containing your changes.  If he likes it, he'll commit it for you!</p>

<p>Your mission is this: The file <code>{{ file_for_git_diff }}</code> contains a terrible error.  Fix it in your working copy to print "Hello world!", rather than "Goodbye world!". Submit your changes as a format-patch file. (You can use your working copy from the previous mission.)</p>

<ul class="raquo_bullets">
  <li>Edit the file to fix the error. Remember that you need to edit files before running git commands!</li>
  <li>Tell git you want to prepare these changes for committing: <code>git add {{ file_for_git_diff }}</code></li>
  <li>Tell git you want to record those changes as a commit, and provide a short message to summarize your commit. For example: <code>git commit -m "Fixed hello world"</code></li>
  <li>Create a file containing the patch: <code>git format-patch origin/master</code></li>
  <li>Open the patch file with a text editor and paste the results in the box below.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Files created by <code>git format-patch</code> are like normal <a href="{% url mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.about %}">patch files</a>, but they also carry information about the <code>git commit</code> that created the patch: the author, the date, and the commit log message are all there at the top of the patch.</p>
