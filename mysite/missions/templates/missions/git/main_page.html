<h3>The set-up</h3>

<p>Somebody out there tried to write a "Hello, world!" program, but they wrote
it as "Goodbye, world!". What a mess! Luckily, you can step in and submit a
patch.  I bet the maintainer would gladly accept it too!</p>

<h3>Audience</h3>

<p>The intended audience are new contributors to open source. If you can edit a
text file and use a terminal, you can complete this mission. </p>

<h3>What you'll learn</h3>

<p>You will learn how to clone a git repository, make a commit, submit a patch,
and rebase your work onto the new version provided by the maintainer.</p>

{% if user.is_authenticated %}
{% if repository_exists %}
<p>You already have a repository that you can use for these missions, but if
you want to start over fresh, you can reset it.</p>

<form method="post" action="{% url "mysite.missions.git.views.resetrepo" %}?stay_on_this_page=1" onsubmit="return confirm('Are you sure you want to reset your repository to its original state?');">{% csrf_token %}
    <input type="submit" value="Reset your repository" />
</form><br style="clear: left;" />

<p class="next_mission_link">
    <a href="{% url "mysite.missions.git.views.long_description" %}">Now let's get Git set up &raquo;</a></p>
  {% else %}
  <p>To do these missions, you will need to make a personal repository.  Your
  repository will reside on the OpenHatch server, specifically for your use in
  these missions.  Then you can go on and interact with it.</p>

<form method="post" action="{% url "mysite.missions.git.views.resetrepo" %}">{% csrf_token %}
  <input type="submit" value="Create your repository and start the missions &raquo;" />
  </form><br style="clear: left;" />

  {% endif %}

  {% else %}
  <p>If you were logged in, you could create a repository that you could use to
  do these missions.</p>
  {% endif %}
