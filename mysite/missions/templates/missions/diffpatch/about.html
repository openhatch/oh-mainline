    <h3>Using diff and patch</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <h2>The set-up</h2>
    <p>Through this training mission, imagine you are a big fan of
      pancakes. Recently, you published a book with all your best
      recipes.</p>

      <p>The book has taken the global pancake community
      by storm, and many of your adoring fans are creating and
      sharing modifications to your recipes through "patch" files.</p>

    <p>In this training mission, by playing different roles, you will
      learn how to create and apply patches via the <tt>diff</tt>
      and <tt>patch</tt> command-line tools.</p>

    <h2>Context in open source</h2>
    <p>For many open source development communities, patches are the
      basis of how contributors describe and share changes.  Projects
      small and large often ask users to "submit a patch" with new
      features or bugfixes. For example, for decades, the Linux kernel
      project has asked contributors to send patch files to the main
      project mailing list for discussion and integration into the
      main project.
    </p>

    <p>This mission consists of four parts: diffing individual files, patching individual files, diffing entire directory hierarchies, and patching entire directory hierarchies.</p>
