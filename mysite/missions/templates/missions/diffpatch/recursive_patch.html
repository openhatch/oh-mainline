    <h3>Patching entire directories</h3>

  <div class="body">
    <h2>Merging contributions</h2>
    <p>Your new cookbook has been a sensation on both sides of the pond.
      Enthusiastic chefs are trading tips on how to cook your recipes.</p>

    <p>As the expert chef, you like to keep abreast of the changes
      floating around in the world of reader-contributed recipes.
      An enterprising American has experimented with your recipes and
      created a few simple modifications that make the flavor really
      pop.</p>

    <p>In this step, you'll download a patch that
      affects more than one file, apply it to your recipe set, and
      answer a question to make sure you applied it properly.</p>

    <p>Here is your mission:</p>
    <ul class="raquo_bullets">
      <li>Download <a href="{% url "mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.diffrecursive_get_original_tarball" %}">this tarball</a> and <a href="{% url "mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.patchrecursive_get_patch" %}">this patch</a> to the same directory.</li>
      <li>Unpack the tarball. This will create a familiar <code>recipes</code> directory.</li>
      <li>Look at the <code>recipes.patch</code> file. Note the file paths in the headers.</li>
      <li>Apply the patch to your <code>recipes</code> directory.</li>
      <li>Answer the question below about the contents of the files inside.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Context in open source</h2>

    <p>Interestingly, the patch we provide here can apply against
      either the British or the American ("aubergine" or "eggplant")
      version of these recipes.

    <p>Sometimes you might have to apply a patch that affects more than one file.  The <code>patch</code> program can tell what parts of the patch apply to what files by examining the headers, but you might need to help it out by giving the <code>-p</code> option to tell it how many levels of directories to ignore so it finds the correct files to patch.</p>

        <p>If you need help with this step, try clicking through these hints.</p>
	<p>The "low" hint level is perfect if you're just confused as to what to do.</p>
	<p>The "high" level is great if you are unfamiliar with the commands and tools you'd use.</p>

    <div id="low">
      <p><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/patch">Read the man page for patch online</a>,</p>
      <p>or, if you're on Linux or Mac, use the terminal command: <pre>man patch</pre></p>
    </div>
    <div id="medium">
      <p>Tips:</p>

      <p>You can invoke <tt>patch</tt> on the downloaded file as follows:</p>

      <p><pre>patch -p1 &lt; recipes.patch</pre></p>

      <p>That should apply the patch file. Open up <tt>recipes.patch</tt> in a text editor and read the patch file "headers". Pay special attention to the directory paths. The <tt>-p1</tt> says to ignore up through the first "/" in the paths in the patch headers when trying to find files to patch.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="high">
      <p>Open a command prompt, and type these commands in, one at a time. You need to copy them exactly. Make sure to press enter between each one.</p>
      <p>First, create a directory you'll work in and change into it.</p>
      <pre>
	mkdir recursivepatch
	cd recursivepatch
      </pre>
      <p>Then, download the original collection of recipes.</p>
      <pre>
	curl -O {{ url_prefix }}{% url "mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.diffrecursive_get_original_tarball" %}
      </pre>
      <p>Unpack it, but do not change into its directory.</p>
      <pre>
	tar xzvf recipes.tar.gz
      </pre>
      <p>Now, download the patch file contributed by the "enterprising American" in this mission step:</p>
      <pre>
	curl -O {{ url_prefix }}{% url "mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.patchrecursive_get_patch" %}
      </pre>
      <p>Apply that patch (you can read more in the "medium" hints about how this works):</p>
      <p><code>patch -p1 &lt; recipes.patch</code></p>
      <p>Now, change directory into <tt>recipes</tt> and open each of the text files in your favorite text editor. Answer the question above!</p>
