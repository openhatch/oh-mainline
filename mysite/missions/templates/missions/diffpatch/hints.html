  <h3><b>Working with patch and diff</b></h3>
  <p>When working with patch, you are dealing with a patch file, which contains a
  list of differences produced by the <em>diff</em> program. The patch file applies
  those differences to one or more original files, producing patched versions.</p>

  <p>In contrast, diff outputs the difference between two files by comparing both
  files line by line.</p>

  <p>This page is just a quick reference; see the bottom for other resources.</p>
  <br>

  <p>To work with patch, you can use:</p><br>
  <b>patch [options] [originalfile [patchfile]]</b><br>
  <p>but the more common method is:<br><br></p>
  <b>patch -pnum &lt; patchfile.patch</b>

  <p>-pnum is the option to tell patch how many levels of directories to ignore so
  it finds the correct files to patch.</p>

  <p>To work with diff, you can use:<br><br>
  <b>diff -u original <em>updatedfile</em></b><br></p>

  <p>For Windows users, you can redirect the output of your diff to a new file
  with this command:<br><br>
  <b>diff -u original new > output.txt</b></p>

  <p><b>-u</b> is the Output NUM (default 3) lines of unified context.</p>
  <p><b>-ur</b> is used when comparing directories of unified context by recursively comparing any subdirectories found.</p>


  <h3><b>Other resources</b></h3>
  <br>
  <p>Patch is an efficent method to fix errors in text files. The following sites have further information about patch:</p>
  <ul class="raquo_bullets">
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix)">Wikipedia has some good information about the <em>patch</em> function.</a></li>
  <li>Patch comes with a user "manual." You can read it by typing <tt>man patch</tt> in a terminal, or by <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/patch">visiting this page</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are many options for <em>diff</em>, which are detailed in diff's documentation. The following sites are good resources for further reading:</p>

  <ul class="raquo_bullets">
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff_(Unix)">Wikipedia has some good information about the <em>diff</em> function.</a></li>
  <li>Diff also comes with a user manual. You can read it by typing <tt>man diff</tt> in a terminal, or by <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/diff">visiting this page</a>.</li>

<!--
<p>If you are running a GNU/Linux distribution, Mac OS X, or another Unix-like operating system, your system almost certainly has the tar program on it already, and you can run it by typing "tar" into a terminal.  If you are running Windows and prefer to try this the Unix way, you can get tar as part of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/BaseSystem/msys-1.0.11/MSYS-1.0.11.exe/download">MSYS</a>; many Windows archiving programs, such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a>, support working with tar archives as well.</p>

      <h3>Unpacking (and listing)</h3>
      <p>To unpack a tarball, you can use:</p>
      <pre>tar xvzf <em>[tarball]</em></pre>
      <p>To be more specific:</p>
      <pre>tar <em>[option letters]</em>xf <em>[tarball]</em></pre>
      <p>(The <code>x</code> stands for e<strong>x</strong>tract.)</p>
      <p>The tarball's contents are placed into the current directory.  Option letter <code>z</code> makes tar transparently un-gzip the tarball, and <code>v</code> shows the filenames as tar unpacks them.</p>
