  <div class="body">
    <h2>Patching individual files</h2>
    <p>Critics love your recipes:</p>

    <blockquote style="width: 95%;">The audacity of the author's "oven pancake" is
    exceeded only by its simplicity, which is further exceeded by its
    tastiness.<br><br>
    <div style="text-align: right;">&mdash; Pancake Digest Weekly</div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>An enthusiastic fan noticed, however, that you forgot to add
      the temperature for the oven! Luckily, she sent you a patch
      with a fix.</p>

    <p>Your task is to download a copy of your original recipe,
    download the contributed patch file, and use the <tt>patch</tt>
    command to combine the two. Once you have done that, submit the
    resulting improved recipe into the form below.</p>

    <p>Essential links:</p>

    <ul class="raquo_bullets">
      <li><a href="{% url mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.patchsingle_get_original_file %}">Your original recipe</a></li>
      <li><a href="{% url mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.patchsingle_get_patch %}">Patch file adding the oven temperature</a></li>
    </ul>


    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="{% url mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.patchsingle_submit %}#patchsingle-form">{% csrf_token %}
      <div class="form-row file-upload-row">
        <a name="patchsingle-form"></a>
        After you patch the file, upload it here:
  {% if patchsingle_success %}
    <div class="successmsg">
      <p><strong>You have successfully completed this part of the mission.</strong></p>
      <p>The file you uploaded has the correct contents.</p>
    </div>
  {% endif %}
        {% if patchsingle_error_message %}
        <ul class="errorlist"><li>{{ patchsingle_error_message }}</li></ul>
        {% endif %}
        {{ patchsingle_form.patched_file.errors }}
        <div class="file-upload">
        {{ patchsingle_form.patched_file }}
        <input type="submit" value="Upload" style="float: left;" />
        </div>
        {% if not patchsingle_success and patchsingle_done %}
        <br style="clear: left;" />
        <em>You have already completed this part of the mission.</em>

        <p>If you need help with this step, try clicking through these hints.</p>
	<p>The "low" hint level is perfect if you're just confused as to what to do.</p>
	<p>The "high" level is great if you are unfamiliar with the commands and tools you'd use.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="low">
      <pre>man patch</pre>
      <p>or
	<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/patch">read the man page online</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="medium">
	 <p>One way to accomplish this is by running a command like <pre>patch -p0 &lt; patch_file</pre> from the command-line, in the directory containing both <code>patch_file</code> and the original file (replace <code>"patch_file"</code> with the actual name of the file you downloaded). This command says "use the patch program to apply the diff in <code>patch_file</code> to a file in the current directory". You can read more about the <code>patch</code> program in its <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/patch">man page</a> (or type <code>man patch</code> at the command-line).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="high">
      <p>Open a command prompt, and type these commands in, one at a time. You need to copy them exactly. Make sure to press enter between each one.</p>
      <p>First, create a directory you'll work in and change into it.</p>
      <pre>
	mkdir singlediffpatch
	cd singlediffpatch
      </pre>
      <p>Then, download the original file and the modified file.</p>
      <pre>
	curl -O {{ url_prefix }}{% url mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.patchsingle_get_original_file %}
	curl -O {{ url_prefix }}{% url mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.patchsingle_get_patch %}
      </pre>
      <p>Then, use the <tt>patch</tt> command to apply the changes.</p>
      <pre>
	patch -p0 &lt; add-oven-temp.patch
      </pre>
      <p>At this point, oven-pancake.txt has been modified. You can
	verify that by opening that file in your favorite text editor.</p>
      <p>Submit the <tt>oven-pancake.txt</tt> file, and you should pass!</p>
