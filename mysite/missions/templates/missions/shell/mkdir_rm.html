        <h3>Creating and removing</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="body">

    <h3>mkdir: Make directory</h3>
    <p> The mkdir command will allow you to create directories. For example,</p>
    <code class="code">$ mkdir penguin</code>
    <p>will create a directory called "penguin".</p>

    <p>Any number of directories can be created simultaneously.
    Thus, for example, the following command would create three directories
    within the current directory (i.e., the directory in which the user is
    currently working) with the names dir1, dir2 and dir3:</p>
    <code class="code">$ mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3</code>
    <p>If a directory with that name already exists in the current directory,
    mkdir will return a warning message such as <kbd class="kbd">mkdir: cannot
    create directory 'dir1': File exists</kbd> and will not create a file
    with that name. However, it will then continue to create directories for any
    other names provided as arguments.</p>

    <h3>rm: Remove files or directories:</h3>
    <p>The command name "rm" is derived from "remove." You can use this command
    to remove or delete a file in your directory. For example, to remove a file named
    <kbd class="kbd">test.txt</kbd> present in your current directory, you can
    type</p>
    <code class="code">$ rm test.txt</code>

    <h3>Removing directories:</h3>
    <p>By default, <kbd class="kbd">rm</kbd> does not remove directories. If the
    <kbd class="kbd">-r (--recursive)</kbd> option is specified, however, it will. For
    example,</p>
    <code class="code">rm -r penguin</code>
    <p>will remove the directory <kbd class="kbd">penguin</kbd> and its contents
    recursively. What does "recursively" mean? Think of it this way: this command will
    remove the directory and all its files and subdirectories, and all the subdirectories'
    files and subdirectories, and on and on ("recursively") until the original directory
    <kbd class="kbd">penguin</kbd> is completely empty.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenge:</h3>
    <p>What is the output of the <kbd class="kbd">ls</kbd> command in the sequence given below?</p>
    <code class="snippet">
    $ ls<br>
    test.txt music<br>
    $ mkdir videos<br>
    $ rm -r music<br>
    $ ls
    </code>
