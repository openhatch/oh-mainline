    <h3>More about virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper</h3>
    <p>Deleting a virtualenv is as simple as creating one. To delete a
    virtualenv in Linux, at the terminal, type <kbd>rmvirtualenv</kbd> followed
    by the name of the virtualenv that you'd like to remove, like so:</p>

    <pre>rmvirtualenv TestEnv</pre>

    <p>The above command will delete the virtualenv <kbd>TestEnv</kbd>,
    that we created earlier.</p>

    <p>Another useful command is <kbd>lsvirtualenv</kbd>, which lists all
    of the virtual environments that we have created so far.</p>

	<p>To delete a virtualenv in Windows, at the Command Prompt type 
	<kbd>rmdir /S</kbd> followed by the name of the virtualenv that you'd 
	like to remove, like this:</p>
	
	<pre>rmdir /S TestEnv</pre>
	
	<p>This deletes all virtualenv files and the directory they were stored
	in.  There is no Windows equivalent for the <kbd>lsvirtualenv</kbd> 
	command.</p>
	
    <p>If you'd like to learn more about virtual environments, we strongly
    recommend going through <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">
    the section about virtualenvs</a> in the book <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/">
    The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python!</a>.</p>

    <p>For a full list of virtualenvwrapper commands, go
    <a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/command_ref.html">
    here</a>.</p>

    <h3>More about pip</h3>
    <p>You can also use pip to search the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">
    Python Package Index (PyPI)</a> for packages. For instance, to search for a
    package that allows you to work with HTTP, type,</p>

    <pre>pip search http</pre>

    <p>or maybe, to search for packages related to <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">
    matplotlib</a>, a Python 2D plotting library, type:</p>

    <pre>pip search matplotlib</pre>

    <p>If you find yourself installing the same package frequently in virtualenvs,
    it quickly becomes a pain to wait for pip to download the package again on every
    separate install. The <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_wheel.html">
    pip wheel</a> command can be used here. Here's the syntax:</p>

    <pre>
      pip wheel <em>foo</em>
      pip install <em>foo</em>
    </pre>

    <p>where <kbd><em>foo</em></kbd> is the name of the package to install.</p>

    <p>The <kbd>pip wheel</kbd> command above downloads the package <kbd><em>
    foo</em></kbd> from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a> and
    keeps it in a special directory of its own. After that, whenever
    you try and install the same package <kbd><em>foo</kbd></em>, pip will skip
    the downloading phase and install it using the the file saved by
    <kbd>pip wheel</kbd>.</p>

    <p>This may not seem like a big deal for small packages, but for large
    packages like matplotlib, which is roughly 48 megabytes in size, <kbd>
    pip wheel</kbd> can save you a lot of time.</p>
