    <h3>Removing packages and deactivating virtualenvs</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="body">

  <h3>Deactivating virtualenvs</h3>
  <p>To deactivate a virtualenv, simply type <kbd>deactivate</kbd> at the
  terminal and press Enter.</p>
  
  <p>You'll notice that after running the <kbd>deactivate</kbd> command,
  your terminal prompt (something like <kbd>C:\Users\username></kbd> on
  Windows or <kbd>user@hostname:~ $</kbd> on Linux/Mac OS X) will no longer
  be prefixed by the name of a virtualenv. This means that no virtualenv is
  active at the moment.</p>

  <p>To activate a virtualenv in Linux, at the terminal type <kbd>workon</kbd>,
  followed by the name of the virtualenv that you'd like to <q>work on</q>
  like so:</p>

  <kbd>workon TestEnv</kbd>
  
  <p>Remember in Windows, your activation command would be:</p>
  
  <kbd>.\TestEnv\Scripts\activate</kbd>

  <p>Go ahead and run the above command to activate the virtualenv <kbd>
  TestEnv</kbd> that we created earlier before moving on to the next section
  about removing packages.</p>

  <h3>Removing packages</h3>
  <p>To uninstall a package, type <kbd>pip uninstall</kbd> followed by
  the name of the package that you'd like to remove.</p>

  <p>Now, let's uninstall the Requests library that we installed earlier.
  At the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:</p>

  <kbd>pip uninstall requests</kbd>

  <p>After Requests has been removed successfully, type <kbd>pip list</kbd>
  at the terminal and press Enter. Just like the <kbd>pip freeze</kbd>
  command, the <kbd>pip list</kbd> command also lists all Python packages
  installed in our environment. The most significant difference between the
  two commands is how they format their output. You can learn more about the subtle
  differences between the <kbd>pip list</kbd> and <kbd>pip freeze</kbd> commands
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18966564/pip-freeze-vs-pip-list">
  here</a>.</p>
  
  <p>To complete this part of the mission, select the output of the
  <kbd>pip list</kbd> command with your mouse and use your terminal program's
  copy-paste functionality to copy it to the clipboard. Paste it into the form
  below. Then, submit!</p>
