This mission is to have you make modifications to a file and submit a
diff of them. The changes may seem a bit silly, but they will cause the
diff to contain examples of different types of changes - additions,
deletions, and changes. Here is what we want you to do to this file:

First, open it in a plain text editor, like emacs, vim, gedit, nano,
Notepad++ (not plain Notepad), TextMate, SubEthaEdit, Sublime,
Smultron, kate, or something else that programmers typically use. Start
by using your editor's "Save As" function to create a new file called
diffsingle-modified.txt. You will need the original file for the
final step!

As you change it, try to keep the formatting intact, as the result
file will be compared character-for-character. There is exactly one
blank line between each paragraph. There is never any space at the
end of a line.

Notice how all the paragraphs have a blank line between them.

Read this sentence, and leave it alone.

Nod your head enthusiastically, and then remove this paragraph
(being careful to keep just one blank line between the surrounding paragraphs).

Take this sentence, and copy it underneath itself (remember the blank line!).

Move this sentence to at the start of the file, ensuring that it
starts on the first line (remember about the blank lines!).

There is a typo in this sentence, which oyu should fix.

Finally, save your changes in your editor and make a unified diff
of your changes with the diff command. (If you're not sure how,
look at the mission page for "Hints".) Submit the diff on the page
from which you obtained the file!

Good luck!
