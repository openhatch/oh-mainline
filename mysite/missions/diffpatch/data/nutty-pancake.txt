Nutty Pancake

== Ingredients ==

* 1 cup all-purpose bleached flour
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 3/4 cup buttermilk
* 1/4 cup milk
* 1 large egg
* 2 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon almond extract
* Vegetable oil for brushing griddle

== Procedure ==

1. Heat a large non-stick skillet or griddle over
   low heat while preparing ingredients.

2. Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking
   soda in medium bowl.

3. Microwave buttermilk and milk in a 2-cup Pyrex
   measuring cup to room temperature, 20 to 30 seconds.

4. Whisk in egg, butter, and almond extract.

5. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until
   just mixed.

6. Return batter to measuring cup, stirring in a teaspoon
   or two of water, if necessary, to make a thick, but pourable batter.

7. Increase heat to medium and generously brush skillet or griddle with
   oil.

8. When oil starts to spider, but before it starts to smoke, pour
   batter, about 1/4 cup at a time.

9. Work in batches, if necessary, to avoid overcrowding.

10. When pancake bottoms are golden brown and tops start to bubble,
    2 to 3 minutes, flip pancakes.

11. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on remaining side.

12. Repeat, brushing skillet or griddle with oil.

Serve hot.
