Description: odict
        =====
        
        Dictionary in which the *insertion* order of items is preserved (using an
        internal double linked list). In this implementation replacing an existing 
        item keeps it at its original position.
        
        Internal representation: values of the dict:
        ::
        
            [pred_key, val, succ_key]
        
        The sequence of elements uses as a double linked list. The ``links`` are dict
        keys. ``self.lh`` and ``self.lt`` are the keys of first and last element 
        inseted in the odict. In a C reimplementation of this data structure, things 
        can be simplified (and speed up) a lot if given a value you can at the same 
        time find its key. With that, you can use normal C pointers.
        
        Memory used (Python 2.5)
        ------------------------
        
        - set(int): 28.2 bytes/element
        
        - dict(int:None): 36.2 bytes/element
        
        - odict(int:None): 102 bytes/element
        
        Performance
        -----------
        
        When running the benchmark script, you get results similar to the one below
        on recent common hardware.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Import and create ordered dictionary.
        ::
        
            >>> from odict import odict
            >>> od = odict()
        
        type conversion to ordinary ``dict``. This will fail.
        ::
        
            >>> dict(odict([(1, 1)]))
            {1: [nil, 1, nil]}
        
        The reason for this is here -> http://bugs.python.org/issue1615701
        
        The ``__init__`` function of ``dict`` checks wether arg is subclass of dict,
        and ignores overwritten ``__getitem__`` & co if so.
        
        This was fixed and later reverted due to behavioural problems with ``pickle``.
        
        Use one of the following ways for type conversion.
        ::
        
            >>> dict(odict([(1, 1)]).items())
            {1: 1}
            
            >>> odict([(1, 1)]).as_dict()
            {1: 1}
        
        It is possible to use abstract mixin class ``_odict`` to hook another dict base
        implementation. This is useful i.e. when persisting to ZODB. Inheriting from
        ``dict`` and ``Persistent`` at the same time fails.
        ::
        
            >>> from persistent.dict import PersistentDict 
            >>> class podict(_odict, PersistentDict):
            ...     def _dict_impl(self):
            ...         return PersistentDict

          chaoflow, rnix, 2010-08-17
        
        Version 1.3.2
        -------------
        
        - Access ``dict`` API providing class via function ``_dict_impl()`` and
          provide odict logic as abstract base class ``_odict``.

        Version 1.3.0
        -------------
        
        - Fix access to ``odict.lt`` and ``odict.lh`` properties. Now it's possible
          to overwrite ``__setattr__`` and ``__getattr__`` on ``odict`` subclass
          without hassle.
          rnix, 2010-04-06

        Version 1.2.4
        -------------
        
        - Do not check for ``key in self`` on ``__delitem__``, ``KeyError`` is raised
          properly anyway. Huge Speedup!

        Version 1.2.3
        -------------
        
        - Move tests to seperate file and make egg testable with 
          ``python setup.py test``.
          rnix, 2009-12-07
        
        - improve ``lt`` and ``lh`` properties to make ``odict`` work with 
          ``copy.deepcopy``.
          rnix, 2009-12-07
        
        Version 1.2.2
        -------------
